[4.6.2]

TODO

[4.6.1]

Patch release to fix some bugs that emerged with 4.6.0.

* Z seam placement.
Changes to the Simplify() algorithm in 4.6.0 caused Z seam placement issues, which resulted in less-than-perfect results. This has been fixed.

* Ender 3 Pro nozzles missing.
A lot of issue reports came in about nozzles missing for this machine definition, so we made a fix to stop this happening.

[4.6.0]

THANK YOU to all Ultimaker Cura users helping in the fight against COVID-19 – with 3D printing, volunteering, or just by staying home. Want to get involved? Find out more at https://ultimaker.com/in/cura/covid-19

* New Intent profiles.
In version 4.4 we introduced Intent profiles for the Ultimaker S3 and Ultimaker S5 which allow you to start prints at the click of a button without a lot of configuration steps. Due to popular demand, version 4.6 expands the range of Engineering Intent profiles to include more of the Ultimaker material portfolio: PC, Nylon, CPE, and CPE+. These work with 0.4 print cores.

* Show active post processing scripts.
fieldOfview has contributed an ease of use improvement to the post processing plugin. The number of enabled post processing scripts will now display as a badge notification over the post processing scripts icon. A tooltip gives extra information about which scripts are enabled for quick and easy inspection, so there's no need to open the post processing dialog.

* Hole Horizontal Expansion.
smartavionics has contributed a new setting that applies an offset to all holes on each layer, allowing you to manually enlarge or contract holes to compensate for horizontal expansion.

* Per-model settings.
The "Infill only" checkbox has been changed to a dropdown selection: “Infill mesh only” or “Cutting mesh”.

* Transparent support rendering.
In preview mode with ‘Line type’ selected, support material will render with transparency so you can easily see what’s being supported.

* No stair stepping for PVA profiles.
Stair stepping is intended to reduce the adhesion between support and the model, where the support rests on the model, and to reduce scarring. As PVA doesn't suffer from scarring or adhesion issues due to its water-solubility, this value has been set to 0 for PVA profiles. A known issue with the stair stepping algorithm causes support to disappear sometimes, so doing this reduces the chance of that happening when PVA is used.

* Separators in extensions menu.
fieldOfview has contributed a method for plugin authors to add separators between menu items in the “Extensions” submenu. The method is backwards-compatible so changes don’t have to be made in Cura and Uranium together.

* Ultimaker account sign in prompt.
Added clearer text to the sign in popup and first use flow to highlight the benefits of using an Ultimaker account with Cura.

* Updated installer.
Small fixes have been made to the installer. To keep up with the times, we’ve also updated the images to display an Ultimaker S3 instead of an Ultimaker 3.

* Infill mesh ordering.
When you have three objects overlapping each other and you set two of them to "Modify settings for infill of other models", then the setting "Infill Mesh Order" determines which of the two infill meshes gets priority where they overlap. This was broken for cutting meshes, so BagelOrb contributed a fix.

* Backups storage size.
We’ve put a hard limit on backup file size in this release to prevent other files being stored there.

* 3MF gcode comments removed.
Fixed a bug where comments were removed from Start/End G-codes when opening from a 3MF.

* Print monitor preheat fields.
Values in the print monitor preheat fields were broken in previous versions, they have now been fixed by fieldOfview.

* Stepper motor disarming during pause at height.
Some printers automatically disable their steppers after a pause after a certain time. This script makes it possible to set that in the pause script (instead of relying on default behavior of the firmware).

* Crash if logging in on two instances at the same time.
During the beta period we caught a critical bug where logging in to an Ultimaker account with two instances of Cura would crash the second instance. It crashes because while the web page is open, Cura opens a web server in the local host. The web page redirects to that web server when you've logged in, so that it knows that the log-in was successful and what the credentials are. Both instances try to create a web server on the same port, which is impossible.

* "Changes detected from your Ultimaker account" message.
We fixed a bug on MacOS where duplicate "Changes detected from your Ultimaker account" popups would appear at a single time.

* Crashes when inactive.
Some people reported experiencing crashes when the computer had been inactive for a long time, or when the laptop got suspended or went to sleep. This has been fixed.

* Support blocker is not blocking support.
Fixed an issue where the support blocker was not blocking support.

* Sending slice message takes too long when using mesh helpers.
Fixed an issue where it would take too long to trigger a slice when using the mesh helpers and support blocker.

* Flying Bear printers.
oducceu has contributed a machine definition for the Flying Bear Ghost 4S Printer.

* Magicfirm printers.
jeffkyjin has contributed machine definitions for MBot Grid II+, MBot Grid II+ (dual), MBot Grid IV+ and MBot Grid IV+ (dual).

* HMS434.
Updates to the HMS434 machine definition have been contributed by maukcc.

* FabX Pro.
hussainsail2002 has contributed machine definitions for FabX Pro and print profiles for REDD materials.

* Disclaimer: Third-party machine definitions are accepted as contributed, and are not tested or maintained in any way by the Cura development team.

[4.5.0]
* Ultimaker Marketplace sync.
Plugins and print profiles downloaded from the Ultimaker Marketplace will now become associated with your Ultimaker account when logged in. If changes are detected in your installation after logging in, an option to sync a list of available packages will become available. You can also add packages to your installation using the web-based Ultimaker Marketplace.

* Layer preview number.
The layer slider number in preview mode is now at the top, instead of on the left, for a neater fit next to the settings panel.

* Project name in window title.
In the same way your browser shows the page title next to the name of the application, Cura now shows the name of the loaded file in the title bar.

* Fuzzy skin outside only.
When enabled, this option prevents fuzzy skin inside holes. This way you can still fit your prints around other things – useful for printing grips or similar applications.

* Brim distance.
This new setting contributed by SmartAvionics allows you to define a gap between the brim and the model for easier brim removal and reduced chance of leaving a mark on the finished piece.

* 'Skin Edge Support' settings.
It’s now possible to add an extra line inside your infill that supports the edge of the skin better. Two new settings contributed by SmartAvionics control this feature: ‘Skin Edge Support Thickness’ and ‘Skin Edge Support Layers’. Find these under ‘Infill settings’.

* Bridge over low density infill.
SmartAvionics has contributed a new setting that determines if the infill density in a location is lower than the specified infill density, skin and walls above it should be treated as bridging.

* Shared heater.
A new ‘Shared heater’ checkbox has been added to the machine settings page to support printers that have one nozzle and one heater, but multiple feeders. When enabled, heating and pre-heating procedures act differently so that the nozzle doesn’t cool down for the stand-by temperature or the initial/final printing temperatures. Contributed by SmartAvionics.

* Material mixing.
A new post-processing script can be used to mix materials if you have a mixing nozzle. Mix materials of different colors in order to print in a different color than either of your currently loaded materials. Contributed by Hrybmo.

* Infill mesh planning.
Another contribution from SmartAvionics optimizes the order in which infill meshes print their parts. It now takes the previous location into account instead of always the starting location.

* Automatic extruder values.
Automatic extruder values are now added for dual extrusion when slicing via the command line.

* Gamma correction for lithopanes.
Loading an image file into Cura creates a heightmap that can be used to make lithopanes. BagelOrb has altered the method of calculating this to apply gamma correction, so that the lightness of the pane is more truthful to the original lightness.

* Support for alpha channels in ImageReader.
Added support for images with transparency, such as PNGs. When using an image with transparency, the contours of the transparent layer will be followed. Contributed by BagelOrb.

* Speed up plugin loading.
fieldOfView has contributed a code optimization to load plugins faster on start. Mileage may vary, but Cura’s startup speed should see a marked improvement.

* Crash logging.
We switched to a more robust provider for crash analytics, so we can develop a more stable product for you. We also added some extra datapoints to crash reports.

* Scene re-rendering.
A new performance enhancement that limits re-rendering of the application interface from ‘constant’ to ‘only-when-necessary’.

* HTTP request handling.
Previous versions used different ways of handling HTTP requests. This version uses a unified method, for better performance.

* Job names less sensitive to being touched.
A contribution from fieldOfview has fixed an issue where the job name in the bottom-left of the scene is no longer made static by clicking on it. If you load a model and change to another printer, the prefix is now correctly updated.

* Property checks on instance containers.
A new speed optimization for reading setting values from profiles.

* Native support has been added for the following third-party printers. Find them in the ‘Add printer’ list.

[4.4.1]
* Bug fixes
 - Fixed problem where wrong material was selected by default.
 - Fixed a problem where custom profiles were disappearing when loading a project without a nozzle profile.

[4.4.0]
*Intent profiles.
What’s the intent of your print? A rapid prototype? A visual prototype? An end-use part with specific holes sizes? Intent profiles accelerate the CAD-CAM workflow by preconfiguring all the right settings in Ultimaker Cura for each of these use cases. Simply select a profile that matches the intent of your design, slice, and you’re ready to print immediately, without the need to adjust the typical settings. For now, there are three Intent profiles:
*‘Draft’
Intended for initial prototypes and concept validation, and will print your design in the shortest time possible.
*‘Engineering’
Intended for high-dimensional accuracy, to print functional prototypes and mechanical end-use parts.
*‘Visual’
Intended for visual prototypes and prints that need excellent aesthetic quality.
For now, these profiles work for the Ultimaker S5 and Ultimaker S3 with Ultimaker PLA, Tough PLA, and ABS materials, and include PVA and Breakaway combinations. More profiles will follow over time.

*Per-model settings.
Per-model settings are a set of very powerful features for users who need to tweak specific settings in specific parts of the model. In previous releases these were buried in the interface somewhat, so this release has made them more discoverable with clear icons in the toolbar, so everyone can discover them. The per-model settings can now be accessed both when working from the recommended and the custom print settings mode.

*Specify network printer.
When connected to an Ultimaker Connect group of multiple printers, Ultimaker Cura once again shows a pop-up to select a designated printer for your printjob. This functionality had been disabled in the last version to ensure reliability when printing remotely.

*Performance improvements.
Various tweaks under the hood for a snappier, more responsive interface. This improvement is most noticeable when switching extruders, print profiles, hovering over tooltips and when scrolling through the print settings list.

*SDK version increment.
The changes made in version 4.4 (mainly for intents but also other things) are so thorough that we needed to do a major increment of the SDK version. Contributors – please update your packages!

*Pause at height message.
A setting has been added to the pause at height script that displays a custom message on screen. This can be used to give instructions to operators to perform an action during the pause, e.g. ‘Place 626 bearings in slots now’.

*Restore window preference.
https://github.com/fieldOfView has contributed a new preference around restoring the previous window position/size to the last used position/size on start up. This would be a workaround for those setups where starting Ultimaker Cura on a secondary screen will prevent it from working.

*Group Linux instances.
https://github.com/MatthewCroughan has contributed a fix so that multiple instances of Ultimaker Cura get grouped in one application group in Gnome (the Linux front-end). It adds a bit of metadata to the .desktop file so that the windows can be grouped.

* Known bugs
Cura not starting on Windows 10. Some users started reporting that Ultimaker Cura 4.3 and higher did not start properly, fur unknown reasons. We have implemented some code to get a better understanding of the issue, but we have not been able to fix it just yet.
As a quick fix: Go to the install path, by default “C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.4”. Right click Cura.exe and select ‘properties’. Click the ‘compatibility’ tab and select “Run This Program in Compatibility Mode For: Windows 8”. If this does not fix your issue, please contact your service provider.

[4.3.0]
*Ultimaker S3.
This release includes a new profile for our latest S-line of 3D printers: the Ultimaker S3. Eagle-eyed beta testers may have noticed this extra printer profile in the beta release, too. Well done to those who spotted it. Learn more about the Ultimaker S3 by reading the blog on Ultimaker.com.

*Even more 3D file formats.
This version is compatible with even more 3D file formats out-of-the-box, so you can integrate CAD software, 3D scanning software, and 3D modeling software into your workflow with ease. Natively open Collada, GLTF, OpenCTM, and PLY formats, to name a few. And don’t forget, downloading plugins from the Ultimaker Marketplace brings in support for many more.

*Align faces to the build plate.
Orienting your models with the rotation tool or the lay flat tool can be a hassle with complex geometries. This new time-saving feature lets you select a face of your model to rest on the build plate, so you can get the orientation you need quickly and easily. Please note this is disabled in compatibility mode (and if your machine is running OpenGL 3.2 or lower).

*Support infill/interface line directions.
Improve reliability with more precise control over certain aspects of your print. Choose the angle that support-infill and interfaces print at, thanks to a contribution from vgribinchuck. Input a set of angles you want lines generated at, and these will be placed sequentially throughout your 3D print.

*Randomize infill start.
Randomize which infill line is printed first. This distributes strength across the model, preventing one segment becoming the weakest link, at the cost of an additional travel move.

*Print small features slower.
Smartavionics has contributed a setting which recognizes small perimeters and reduces print speed in order to boost the reliability and accuracy of small printed features. This is especially useful for small perimeters such as printed holes, as they tend to get ripped away from the build plate easily due to their low contact area.

*Easy selector for Z seam positions.
Z seams are now easier to position on your model, thanks to a contribution by trouch. A drop down selection box has been added to custom mode, giving you a list of presets to place the z seam on your model.

*Colorblind assist theme.
Nubnubbud has added a new theme for colorblind users which makes more distinction between colors, such as the yellow/green line colors in the layer view.

*DisplayFilenameAndLayerOnLCD script.
Some improvements for this post processing script from the community. N95JPL has contributed updates to offer a wider range of optional information. Adecastilho has contributed updates so that the layer count is displayed before the filename to prevent the layer number getting truncated in the event of long filename, as well as an option to start layer count at either 0 or 1. The ':' in the display string has also been removed as it is a GCODE command that splits the line into two different commands.

*Peripheral information for output devices.
Architectural changes in Ultimaker Cura to allow display information about peripherals in the printer output device, so that I can use it to later on show that information in the Monitor stage plugin.

*Quality changes on import.
Users can now import profiles that have been created on a different machine other than the active one.

*Remove prime after coasting.
Reduce the visibility of the z seam when printing with coasting by preventing nozzle priming.

*Map Material Station slot data.
The available configurations drop down will display information about a Ultimaker S5 Material Station if connected. Read more about the Ultimaker S5 Material Station on ultimaker.com

*Manage Printer link.
Added a “Manage Printer” link in the monitor tab which takes you to Ultimaker Connect.

*Improvement in code quality.
Improved code quality resulting in improved stability.

* Bug fixes
- Uninstall in silent mode. Fixed an issue where a dialog displays when uninstalling in silent mode.
- Build Interface if Support is Present. In some cases, support could be pushed away by large support XY distance, but interfaces could be left on overhangs which leads to situation when interface is generated without support. This has been fixed.
- Install in silent mode. The bundled Arduino driver is signed by a certificate that's not trusted on Windows by default, so there was no way to suppress the prompt or to have the installer skip driver installation. This has been fixed.
- 3MF project printer connection not included. When loading a project file that was saved while a network connection was active, the network connection is not re-established. This has been fixed.
- Thin Walls broken. Fixed an error with thin walls being broken.
- Tray icon remaining. Fixed a bug where the tray icon would remain after closing the application.
- Marketplace text. Fixed an issue where Marketplace text is blurry on some screens
- Unsupported profile imports. Fixed an issue where exported profiles could not be reimported.
- Loading file message. Added visual feedback when loading files such as STLs
- Loading GCODE on disabled extruders. Fixed an issue where GCODE imported using multi-extrusion fails to load if an extruder is disabled.
- Support brim with concentric support pattern. Fixed an issue where support would be in mid-air.
- Reduced cloud logging. Logging has been reduced for cloud connections on unstable connections.
- Application menu extruder menu. Fixed an issue where changing the extruder via the application menu didn’t work.
- Tool handles move when rotating. Fixed an issue where rotate tool handles would change location when rotating.
- F5 reload. Fixed an issue where F5 doesn't reload GCODE.
- Application not starting before the splash screen. Fixed an issue where the application wouldn’t start before the splash window.
- Qt 5.13 crashes. Fixed an issue where the ShaderEffect crashes using Qt 5.13
- Can’t select other materials in print setting tab. Fixed an issue where other materials couldn’t be selected using the print settings tab.
- Drop down to buildplate after resize. Models don’t drop down to the build plate if they are scaled down from ‘too large to fit’.
- Unsupported quality profiles. Fixed unsupported quality profiles appearing for 0.25 + 0.8 print core combinations.
- 'Arrange all models' for groups. Fixed an issue where arrange all models hangs for grouped models.
- Update Checker not working. Fixed this so that updates are visible if using a legacy version.
- Missing support brim. Fixed an issue where support brim was missing if platform adhesion set to ‘None’.
- Multiply non-normal mesh doesn't work. Fixed instances where processes stopped and messages would hang.
- Settings not updating in GUI with inheritance. Fixed settings not updating GUI with inheritance.
- Prevent 'generic'-part in name of specific materials. Introduced checks for ‘generic’ material types to help material categorization.
- Hide temperature settings. The "Default Print Temperature" setting is currently editable, but editing this setting can cause problems with temperatures later especially when you have it in your custom profile. We decided to hide this setting so users can no longer edit it in the later releases to avoid confusion. The "Default Build Plate Temperature" has also been hidden because it causes a similar issue.
- Add machine_heated_build_volume. Introduced a new machine_heated_build_volume machine-setting, which is set it to false by default, and only set it to true for the Ultimaker S5. Users can alter their own definition if they do have a heated build volume.
- Z-hops on first layer. First move other start GCODE not z-hopped. Contributed by sailorgreg.
- Preserve extruder-only moves in post stretch script. Contributed by sgtnoodle.
- “Print via Cloud” is no longer possible without an Internet connection
- Monitor tab no longer sometimes shows incorrect printer name or type
- Long print job names are no longer overlapping other text in the monitor tab
- “Connected to Cloud” pop-up now only displays when the currently selected printer is connected to Ultimaker cloud.
- Monitor tab is no longer greyed out when idle.

*Third-party printer definitions
New machine definitions added for:
- IMADE3D Jellybox. Contributed by filipgoc for IMADE3D Jellybox printers, which adds JellyBOX 2 printer and revises settings of JellyBOX Original.
- Vertex Nano. Contributed by velbn
- Felix Pro 2. Contributed by pnks
- JGAurora A35. Contributed by pinchies.
- eMotionTech Strateo3D. Contributed by KOUBeMT.
- NWA3D A31. Contributed by DragonJe.

[4.2.0]
*Orthographic view.
When preparing prints, professional users wanted more control over the 3D view type, so this version introduces an orthographic view, which is the same view type used by most professional CAD software packages. Find the orthographic view in View > Camera view > Orthographic, and compare the dimensions of your model to your CAD design with ease.

*Object list.
Easily identify corresponding filenames and models with this new popup list. Click a model in the viewport and its filename will highlight, or click a filename in the list and the corresponding model will highlight. The open or hidden state of the list will persist between sessions. How convenient.

*Print previews.
Some improvements have been made to print previews displayed in the monitor tab, Ultimaker Connect, or the Ultimaker S5 interface. In some instances, previews were clipped at the bottom or side, and sometimes models outside of the build plate area were visible. This is all fixed now.

*AMF file compatibility.
Ultimaker Cura now supports AMF (Additive manufacturing file format) files out-of-the-box, thanks to an AMF file reader contributed by fieldOfView.

*Slice button delay.
After clicking ‘Slice’, a lack of response could lead to frustrated buttonclicking. This version changes the button text to read ‘Processing’ during any pre-slicing delay.

*Layer view line type.
The line type color scheme in the layer view has been tweaked with new colors for infill and support interfaces so that they can be distinguished better.

*Nozzle switch prime distance.
Certain materials “ooze” more than others during retraction and long moves. Vgribinchuk has contributed a new setting that lets you finetune the restart distance, so that the full extrusion width is achieved when resuming a print.

*Smart Z seam.
A new option to increase the aesthetic quality of your prints has been added to custom mode, under Z seam settings. Smart Z seam works by analyzing your model’s geometry and automatically choosing when to hide or expose the seam, so that visible seams on outer walls are kept to a minimum.

*Separate Z axis movements.
Z axis movement handling has been improved to reduce the chance of print head collisions with prints.

*Flow per feature.
You can now adjust material flow for specific features of your print, such as walls, infill, support, prime towers, and adhesion. This allows line spacing to be controlled separately from flow settings.

*Merge infill lines.
We did some finetuning of the CuraEngine to improve print quality by filling thin infill areas more precisely and efficiently, and reducing movements that caused excessive gantry vibration.

*Z hop speed.
The Z hop speed for printers with no specific speed value would default to ‘299792458000’ (light speed!) The new Z hop speed setting ensures that all Z hops are performed at a more sensible speed, which you can control.

*Support tower diameter.
The ‘Minimum diameter’ setting for support towers has been renamed to ‘Maximum Tower-Supported Diameter’, which is more accurate and more specific because it mentions towers.

*Square prime towers.
Circular prime towers are now the default option. Square prime towers have been eradicated forever.

*Third-party printer order.
The ‘add printer’ menu now includes third-party printers that are ordered by manufacturer, so that specific machines can be found easily. Printer definitions. New machine definitions added for:
- Anet A6 contributed by markbernard
- Stereotech ST320 and START contributed by frylock34
- Erzay3D contributed by Robokinetics
- FL Sun QQ contributed by curso007
- GeeTech A30 contributed by curso007

*Creawsome mod.
This version has pulled the Creawsome mod, made by trouch, which adds a lot of print profiles for Creality printers. It includes definitions for Creality CR10 Mini, CR10s, CR10s Pro, CR20, CR20 Pro, Ender 2, Ender 4 and Ender 5, and updates the definitions for CR10, CR10s4, CR10s5 and Ender3. The CRX is untouched. Pull requests are now submitted that merge the mod into mainline Cura.

* Bug fixes
- Noto Sans. Noto Sans was introduced as the default font in Ultimaker Cura some versions ago, but until now it wouldn’t render properly in the application unless already installed on your computer. This release forces the application to render Noto Sans even when it’s not installed as a font on your computer. Fun fact: Ultimaker recently rebranded, and we made Noto Sans our corporate font as well.
- Reslice with per-model settings. When slicing a model with per-model settings, a change of one of the per model settings would not trigger a reslice. This has been fixed. Serial port interruptions. This version adds a way to stop serial connections if you add command line parameters.
- Print one-at-a-time blob. In print-one-at-a-time mode, prime blobs could cause obstructions and cause prints to fail. This has been fixed.
- Prime tower brim overlap fix. Fixed an issue where models on the build plate could overlap with brims of other models.
- Wrong printer name. Fixed an issue where Ultimaker 3D printers that are synchronized over the network would display ‘Extruder 1’ in place of the printer’s hostname.
- Unnecessary travel at print start. Fixed an issue where printing without a prime blob would cause the print head to make a 10 mm travel move for no reason.
- Stair step height. This version fixes support stair step height, which influences the adhesion between the model and support printed on top (supports everywhere). For now, this bug has had no influence on PVA supported prints.

[4.1.0]
*Draggable settings panels
There was a lot of feedback from the 4.0 release about the collapsible settings panels. Based on this feedback, we decided to make them completely draggable. The print settings panel (prepare stage) and the color scheme panel (preview stage) can now be dragged and positioned anywhere in the 3D viewer. A double click of the header will reset each to their default position.

*Updated onboarding flow.
The onboarding flow on first startup has been updated with a look and feel more in line with the new interface. A series of setup steps will be shown, including Welcome, User agreement, Change log, the option to add a (networked) printer, and the option to sign up/sign in with an Ultimaker account.

*Add printer menu.
Various updates in the ‘Add printer menu’. The machine settings menu has been updated in line with the new look and feel of the interface, and it's now possible to directly add machines from discovered network printers.

*Expert settings visibility.
Previously, new settings weren't displayed in the expert preset even though they were expert-level settings. The latest features (e.g. Prime tower brim) are now included in the expert preset, for easy access.

*Experimental print profile indicator.
When an experimental print profile is activated, the settings panel header will now display an "Experimental" tag.

*Printing guidelines.
More information about how to print advanced materials can be quickly and easily accessed via the interface. When a material is chosen in the configuration selector, an icon will appear next to it, which when clicked will direct the user to a 'Printing Guidelines' page specified by the print profile supplier.

*Increased rendering speed.
Rendering speed improvements that should be quite noticeable with multiple objects on the build plate.

*Layer change script.
This new post-processing script injects custom Gcode on a layer change, so that manual commands can be defined, e.g. park the print head. Contributed by wporter82. https://github.com/wporter82

*Prime tower brim.
Prime towers might need the extra adhesion of a brim even when the model doesn’t, so an option for a prime tower to print with a brim independently of the model has been added. This setting is available when the adhesion type is set to 'None', 'Skirt' or 'Brim', and the prime tower is enabled. Currently this option doesn’t work with rafts.

*Prime tower Gcode comments.
Gcode now contains comments to indicate when a prime tower is printed, like so: {code};TYPE:PRIME-TOWER{code}

*Maximum deviation setting.
Previously, the maximum deviation was hard-coded in CuraEngine to be half of the maximum resolution. A new setting has been added that sets the maximum allowed deviation from the original polygon when reducing model resolution. If line segments are shorter than the maximum resolution, they are removed, unless this introduces a deviation greater than the maximum deviation.

*Gyroid support.
Smartavionics has contributed a new option for a gyroid support pattern, similar to his gyroid infill contribution. A gyroid pattern is relatively efficient with material, so gyroid patterns permeable to water can dissolve faster. It’s also easier to pull gyroid structures off your model with pliers compared to some other support patterns. https://github.com/smartavionics

*Purchase materials.
The Marketplace now includes a direct link to a site where users can buy specific materials to work with the corresponding print profile. The link is specified by the print profile supplier through the contributor portal.

*Marketplace notifications.
When a plugin or print profile in the Marketplace has updates, a badge notification will appear over the Marketplace button and installed packages tab, prompting you to update.

*Bug fixes:
- Fixed an issue where the application crashed when opening the Ultimaker Marketplace after being logged in for more than 10 minutes. This was due to an expired token when checking network requests.
- For PLA-PLA support combinations, the horizontal expansion value has changed from 0.2 to 0 by default. This fixes an issue where unnecessary support is generated. The default value for PVA remains the same.
- Fixed an issue where choosing to "Update Existing" profile during project file loading did not overwrite the current settings with what was in the project file.
- Removed the GFF and CFF materials from this version onwards. These materials are intended only for testing and are incompatible with the Ultimaker 2+
- Fixed an issue where the maximum resolution setting removed more vertices than necessary.
- Improved gyroid infill to stop very small (less than 10 uM) line segments being created when the gyroid infill lines are connected, increasing print consistency and reliability. Contributed by smartavionics https://github.com/smartavionics
- Previously, disabling build plate adhesion would also disable support brim settings. A support brim can now be enabled independently of build plate adhesion.
- Improved combing moves over thin model areas. Contributed by smartavionics https://github.com/smartavionics
- Fixed an issue where the printer selector panel text would exceed the boundaries of popups in languages other than English.
- Removed the ability to create print profiles with duplicate names in the print profile manager. Print profiles with the equal names would eventually lead to crashes or undefined behavior.
- Fixed an issue where the application would not remember the previous save path after saving again in the same session.
- Older machines running Mac OS X don't always support OpenGL 4.0+. For better performance the software can now detect if a machine doesn’t support it, and use OpenGL 2.0 instead. Contributed by fieldOfview. https://github.com/fieldofview
- Fixed an issue where the application would crash when selecting the support eraser tool.
- Fixed an issue where Z seams didn’t snap to the sharpest corner.
- Fixed issues where prints would have imperfections and on vertical surfaces.

[4.0.0]
*Updated user interface
Ultimaker Cura is a very powerful tool with many features to support users’ needs. In the new UI, we present these features in a better, more intuitive way based on the workflow of our users. The Marketplace and user account control have been integrated into the main interface to easily access material profiles and plugins. Three stages are shown in the header to give a clear guidance of the flow. The stage menu is populated with collapsible panels that allow users to focus on the 3D view when needed, while still showing important information at the same time, such as slicing configuration and settings. Users can now easily go to the preview stage to examine the layer view after slicing the model, which previously was less obvious or hidden. The new UI also creates more distinction between recommended and custom mode. Novice users or users who are not interested in all the settings can easily prepare a file, relying on the strength of expert-configured print profiles. Experienced users who want greater control can configure over 300 settings to their needs.

*Redesigned "Add Printer" dialog
Updated one of the first dialogs a new user is presented with. The layout is loosely modeled on the layout of the Ultimaker 3/Ultimaker S5 "Connect to Network" dialog, and adds some instructions and intention to the dialog. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*Updated custom mode panel
Based on feedback from 4.0 beta, the custom mode panel is now resizable to make more settings visible. The set position will persist between sessions.

*Monitor tab
Updated the monitor tab interface for better alignment with Cura Connect interface.

*Remote printing
Use your Ultimaker S5 printer with an Ultimaker account to send and monitor print jobs from outside your local network. Requires firmware 5.2 (coming soon).

*User ratings for plugins
With an Ultimaker account, users can now give feedback on their experience by rating their favourite plugins.

*Integrated backups
‘Cura backups’ has been integrated into Ultimaker Cura and can be found in the ‘extensions’ menu. With this feature, users can use their Ultimaker account to backup their Ultimaker Cura configurations to the cloud for easy, convenient retrieval.

*Plugin versioning
Newer plug-ins can't load in older versions if they use newer features, while old plug-ins may still load in newer versions.

*LAN and cloud printer icons
Users can now quickly see if their printer is network or cloud enabled with new icons.

*Improved UI speed
This version switches faster between extruders and printers. Your mileage may vary depending on your system specifications.

*Floats precision
No settings in Ultimaker Cura require more than three digits of precision, so floats in setting input fields have been limited to three digits only. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*Minimum support area
This feature allows set minimum area size for support and support interface polygons. Polygons which area are smaller than set value will not be generated. Contributed by vgribinchuk/Desktop Metal.

*Lazy Tree Support calculation
In previous versions, 95% of Tree Support’s computation time was used to calculate the collision volumes to make sure that the branches avoid collisions with the meshes. Now it calculates these volumes only when necessary, reducing the computation time. Contributed by bjude.

*CPE and CPE+ comb retractions
Changed all CPE and CPE+ profiles to travel up to 50 mm without retraction, decreasing blobs caused by combing long distances.

*Marketplace improvements
Added optimizations to show a support site instead of an email address, increased the number of lines that are shown for the description, and show a 'website' link so people can order material directly.

*Arduino drivers silent install
Previous versions stopped silent installation because the Arduino drivers packaged with Cura are not signed. Arduino drivers are now skipped when performing a silent install.

*New third-party definitions

- Fixed an issue where the legacy profile importer would generate corrupt profiles.
- Fixed an issue where Ultimaker Cura could crash on start-up during the upgrading of your configuration to the newest version for some people.
- Fixed an issue where Ultimaker Cura would crash after downloading plugin from Marketplace.
- Ignores plugins folder when checking files for version upgrade. Start-up is now much faster if you've installed a lot of plugins or have used many versions of Ultimaker Cura.
- Fixed an issue where the firmware checker shows up when there is no internet connection.
- Fixed an issue where settings could not be made visible again after hiding all settings.
- Fixed false configuration error for CC Red 0.6 core after a version upgrade.
- Fixed an issue where a warning is issued when selecting a printer with no material loaded. The extruder will now be disabled instead.

[3.6.0]
*Gyroid infill
New infill pattern with enhanced strength properties. Gyroid infill is one of the strongest infill types for a given weight, has isotropic properties, and prints relatively fast with reduced material use and a fully connected part interior. Note: Slicing time can increase up to 40 seconds or more, depending on the model. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Support brim
New setting that integrates the first layer of support material with the brim’s geometry. This significantly improves adhesion when printing with support material. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Cooling fan number
It is now possible to specify the cooling fan to use if your printer has multiple fans. This is implemented under Machine settings in the Extruder tab. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Settings refactor
The CuraEngine has been refactored to create a more testable, future-proof way of storing and representing settings. This makes slicing faster, and future development easier.

*Print core CC 0.6
The new print core CC 0.6 is selectable when the Ultimaker S5 profile is active. This print core is optimized for use with abrasive materials and composites.

*File name and layer display
Added M117 commands to GCODE to give real-time information about the print job file name and layer number shown on the printer’s display when printing via USB. Contributed by adecastilho.

*Firmware checker/Ultimaker S5
The update checker code has been improved and tested for more reliable firmware update notifications in Ultimaker Cura. The Ultimaker S5 is now included.

*Fullscreen mode shortcuts
Fullscreen mode can be toggled using the View menu or with the keyboard shortcuts: Command + Control + F (macOS), or F11 (Windows and Linux). Contributed by KangDroid.

*Configuration error message
In previous versions, Ultimaker Cura would display an error dialog explaining when something happened to user configuration files, including the option to reset to factory defaults. This would not warn about losing the current printer and print profile settings, so this information has been added.

*Rename Toolbox to Marketplace
The entry points to the Toolbox are now renamed to Marketplace.

*Materials in the Marketplace
A new tab has been added to the Marketplace that includes downloadable material profiles, to quickly and easily prepare models for a range of third-party materials.

*New third-party definitions
New profiles added for Anycube 4MAx and Tizyx K25. Contributed by jscurtu and ValentinPitre respectively.

*Improved definitions for Ender-3
The Ender-3 build plate size has been adjusted to the correct size of 235 x 235 mm, corrected the start-up sequence, and the printhead position has been adjusted when prints are purged or completed. Contributed by stelgenhof.

*Add mesh names to slicing message
Added comment generation to indicate which mesh the GCODE after this comment is constructing. Contributed by paukstelis.

*Bug fixes
- The active material is highlighted in Ultimaker Cura’s material manager list. This behavior is now consistent with the profile and machine manager.
- The option to use 1.75 mm diameter filament with third-party 3D printers is now fixed and does not revert back to 2.85 mm. This fix also applies the appropriate a Z-axis speed change for 1.75 mm filament printers. Contributed by kaleidoscopeit.
- A fix was created to handle OSX version 10.10, but due to the QT upgrade, users with older versions won’t be able to run Ultimaker Cura on their system without a system update. This applies to OSX version 10.09 and 10.08.
- Fixed a memory leak when leaving the “Monitor” page open.
- Added performance improvements to the PolygonConnector to efficiently connect polygons that are close to each other. This also reduces the chances of the print head collide with previously printed things. Contributed by BagelOrb.
- Fixed a bug where the GCODE reader didn’t show retractions.
- Changes the USBPrinting update thread to prevent flooding the printer with M105 temperature update requests. Contributed by fieldOfView.

[3.5.0]
*Monitor page
The monitor page of Ultimaker Cura has been remodeled for better consistency with the Cura Connect ‘Print jobs’ interface. This means less switching between interfaces, and more control from within Ultimaker Cura.

*Open recent projects
Project files can now be found in the ‘Open Recent’ menu.

*New tool hotkeys
New hotkeys have been assigned for quick toggling between the translate (T), scale (S), rotate (R) and mirror (M) tools.

*Project files use 3MF only
A 3MF extension is now used for project files. The ‘.curaproject’ extension is no longer used.

*Camera maximum zoom
The maximum zoom has been adjusted to scale with the size of the selected printer. This fixes third-party printers with huge build volumes to be correctly visible.

*Corrected width of layer number box
The layer number indicator in the layer view now displays numbers above 999 correctly.

*Materials preferences
This screen has been redesigned to improve user experience. Materials can now be set as a favorites, so they can be easily accessed in the material selection panel at the top-right of the screen.

*Installed packages checkmark
Packages that are already installed in the Toolbox are now have a checkmark for easy reference.

*Mac OSX save dialog
The save dialog has been restored to its native behavior and bugs have been fixed.

*Removed .gz extension

*Updates to Chinese translations
Improved and updated Chinese translations. Contributed by MarmaladeForMeat.

*Save project
Saving the project no longer triggers the project to reslice.

*File menu
The Save option in the file menu now saves project files. The export option now saves other types of files, such as STL.

*Improved processing of overhang walls
Overhang walls are detected and printed with different speeds. It will not start a perimeter on an overhanging wall. The quality of overhanging walls may be improved by printing those at a different speed. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Prime tower reliability
The prime tower has been improved for better reliability. This is especially useful when printing with two materials that do not adhere well.

*Support infill line direction
The support infill lines can now be rotated to increase the supporting capabilities and reduce artifacts on the model. This setting rotates existing patterns, like triangle support infill. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*Minimum polygon circumference
Polygons in sliced layers that have a circumference smaller than the setting value will be filtered out. Lower values lead to higher resolution meshes at the cost of increased slicing time. This setting is ideal for very tiny prints with a lot of detail, or for SLA printers. Contributed by cubiq.

*Initial layer support line distance
This setting enables the user to reduce or increase the density of the support initial layer in order to increase or reduce adhesion to the build plate and the overall strength.

*Extra infill wall line count
Adds extra walls around infill. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Multiply infill
Creates multiple infill lines on the same pattern for sturdier infill. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Connected infill polygons
Connecting infill lines now also works with concentric and cross infill patterns. The benefit would be stronger infill and more consistent material flow/saving retractions. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Fan speed override
New setting to modify the fan speed of supported areas. This setting can be found in Support settings > Fan Speed Override when support is enabled. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Minimum wall flow
New setting to define a minimum flow for thin printed walls. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Custom support plugin
A tool downloadable from the toolbox, similar to the support blocker, that adds cubes of support to the model manually by clicking parts of it. Contributed by Lokster.

*Quickly toggle autoslicing
Adds a pause/play button to the progress bar to quickly toggle autoslicing. Contributed by fieldOfview.

*Cura-DuetRRFPlugin
Adds output devices for a Duet RepRapFirmware printer: "Print", "Simulate", and "Upload". Contributed by Kriechi.

*Dremel 3D20
This plugin adds the Dremel printer to Ultimaker Cura. Contributed by Kriechi.

*Bug fixes
- Removed extra M109 commands. Older versions would generate superfluous M109 commands. This has been fixed for better temperature stability when printing.
- Fixed minor mesh handling bugs. A few combinations of modifier meshes now lead to expected behavior.
- Removed unnecessary travels. Connected infill lines are now always printed completely connected, without unnecessary travel moves.
- Removed concentric 3D infill. This infill type has been removed due to lack of reliability.
- Extra skin wall count. Fixed an issue that caused extra print moves with this setting enabled.
- Concentric skin. Small gaps in concentric skin are now filled correctly.
- Order of printed models. The order of a large batch of printed models is now more consistent, instead of random.

*Third party printers
- TiZYX
- Winbo
- Tevo Tornado
- Creality CR-10S
- Wanhao Duplicator
- Deltacomb (update)
- Dacoma (update)

[3.4.1]
*Bug fixes
- Fixed an issue that would occasionally cause an unnecessary extra skin wall to be printed, which increased print time.
- Fixed an issue in which supports were not generated on the initial layer, because the engine expected a brim to be in place.
- Conical and tree supports are now limited within the build plate volume.
- Fixed various startup crashes, including: copying of the version folder, errors while deleting packages, storing the old files, and losing data on install.

[3.4.0]

*Toolbox
The plugin browser has been remodeled into the Toolbox. Navigation now involves graphical elements such as tiles, which can be clicked for further details.

*Upgradable bundled resources
It is now possible to have multiple versions of bundled resources installed: the bundled version and the downloaded upgrade. If an upgrade in the form of a package is present, the bundled version will not be loaded. If it's not present, Ultimaker Cura will revert to the bundled version.

*Package manager recognizes bundled resources
Bundled packages are now made visible to the CuraPackageMangager. This means the resources are included by default, as well as the "wrapping" of a package, (e.g. package.json) so that the CuraPackageManger and Toolbox recognize them as being installed.

*Retraction combing max distance
New setting for maximum combing travel distance. Combing travel moves longer than this value will use retraction. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Infill support
When enabled, infill will be generated only where it is needed using a specialized support generation algorithm for the internal support structures of a part. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Print outside perimeter before holes
This prioritizes outside perimeters before printing holes. By printing holes as late as possible, there is a reduced risk of travel moves dislodging them from the build plate. This setting should only have an effect if printing outer before inner walls. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Disable omitting retractions in support
Previous versions had no option to disable omitting retraction moves when printing supports, which could cause issues with third-party machines or materials. An option has been added to disable this. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Support wall line count
Added setting to configure how many walls to print around supports. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Maximum combing resolution
Combing travel moves are kept at least 1.5 mm long to prevent buffer underruns.

*Avoid supports when traveling
Added setting to avoid supports when performing travel moves. This minimizes the risk of the print head hitting support material.

*Rewrite cross infill
Experimental setting that allows you to input a path to an image to manipulate the cross infill density. This will overlay that image on your model. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Backup and restore
Added functionality to backup and restore settings and profiles to cloud using the Cura Backups plugin.

*Auto-select model after import
User can now set preferences for the behavior of selecting a newly imported model or not.

*Settings filter timeout
The settings filter is triggered on enter or after a 500ms timeout when typing a setting to filter.

*Event measurements
Added time measurement to logs for occurrences, including startup time, file load time, number of items on the build plate when slicing, slicing time, and time and performance when moving items on the build plate, for benchmarking purposes.

*Send anonymous data
Disable button on the ‘Send anonymous data’ popup has changed to a ‘more info’ button, with further options to enable/disable anonymous data messages.

*Configuration error assistant
Detect and show potential configuration file errors to users, e.g. incorrect files and duplicate files in material or quality profiles, there are several places to check. Information is stored and communicated to the user to prevent crashing in future.

*Disable ensure models are kept apart
Disable "Ensure models are kept apart" by default due to to a change in preference files.

*Prepare and monitor QML files
Created two separate QML files for the Prepare and Monitor stages.

*Hide bed temperature
Option to hide bed temperature when no heated bed is present. Contributed by ngraziano.

*Reprap/Marlin GCODE flavor
RepRap firmware now lists values for all extruders in the "Filament used" GCODE comment. Contributed by smartavionics.

*AutoDesk Inventor integration
Open AutoDesk inventor files (parts, assemblies, drawings) directly into Ultimaker Cura. Contributed by thopiekar.

*Blender integration
Open Blender files directly into Ultimaker Cura. Contributed by thopiekar.

New version of the MakePrintable plugin.

*Compact Prepare sidebar
Plugin that replaces the sidebar with a more compact variation of the original sidebar. Nozzle and material dropdowns are combined into a single line, the “Check compatibility” link is removed, extruder selection buttons are downsized, recommended and custom mode selection buttons are moved to a combobox at the top, and margins are tweaked. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*PauseAtHeight plugin
Bug fixes and improvements for PauseAtHeight plugin. Plugin now accounts for raft layers when choosing “Pause of layer no.” Now positions the nozzle at x and y values of the next layer when resuming. Contributed by JPFrancoia.

*Bug fixes
- Prime tower purge fix. Prime tower purge now starts away from the center, minimizing the chance of overextrusion and nozzle obstructions. Contributed by BagelOrb.
- Extruder 2 temp via USB. Fixed a bug where temperatures can’t be read for a second extruder via USB. Contributed by kirilledelman.
- Move to next object position before bed heat. Print one at a time mode caused waiting for the bed temperature to reach the first layer temperature while the nozzle was still positioned on the top of the last part. This has been fixed so that the nozzle moves to the location of the next part before waiting for heat up. Contributed by smartavionics.
- Non-GCODE USB. Fixed a bug where the USB port doesn’t open if printer doesn't support GCODE. Contributed by ohrn.
- Improved wall overlap compensation. Minimizes unexpected behavior on overlap lines, providing smoother results. Contributed by BagelOrb.

Configuration and synchronization button now available for Ultimaker network-connected printers to easily synchronize all possible available configurations in your Cura Connect group. The name of the group host is automatically pulled from the API, and network printers and local printers are separated in the list for clarity.

*Setting visibility preset
Presets guide you to find the most important settings incrementally. A small menu is located next to the search bar to easily access these new setting visibility presets. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*Print/save hotkey
Send a print to the queue using Ctrl + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + P (Mac). If no printer is present on the network, it will save to file instead.

*3D model assistant
Models sliced to print with ABS, PC, PP or CPE+ that have a larger footprint than 150 x 150 x 150 mm will notify the user with an icon and popup of how they can achieve the best possible print quality and reliability.

*Refactored machine manager
Refactored machine manager resulted in less manager classes. Changing settings, materials, variants and machines is now clearer. This results in an overall speed up when making changes.

*Multiply models faster
Significant speed increase when multiplying models.

*Auto slicing disabled by default
The auto slice tool is now disabled by default. Users can still enable the feature in the user preferences dialog.

*Updated fonts
Default font changed to NotoSans to increase readability and consistency with Cura Connect.

*Plugin browser look and feel
The plugin browser has been updated with a better look and feel to bring it in line with other UI elements. The author name is clickable, which opens email for support. Plugins can now be uninstalled with an uninstall button.

*Show tooltip for unavailable profile
Tooltips have been added to incompatible settings, to give explanations why they are incompatible.

*Empty material slots Ultimaker 3
When a material is not loaded in the Ultimaker 3, it is now displayed as ‘Empty’ rather than ‘Unknown’.

*Send over network confirmation
When a print job is sent to a networked printer, a popup will confirm the job was sent, with a button to redirect the user to the monitor in Cura Connect.

*Post processing scripts
Fixed an issue where post processing scripts could be lost between sessions. Post processing scripts are now persistent between sessions.

*Single extrusion mode
Disable an extruder on a dual extrusion printer, so you are not limited by the other extruder’s parameters. To disable an extruder, right click it in the right panel, and select ‘Disable extruder’ to disable it. Re-enable by right clicking and selecting ‘enable extruder’. Printing profiles are optimized for the active extruder, as well as global settings, such as build plate temperature, to achieve better print quality. Using single extrusion mode also makes the ‘print one at a time’ feature available for the Ultimaker 3 and Ultimaker S5.

*New UFP extension
UFP (Ultimaker format package) is a new file extension that contains compressed gcode and a preview thumbnail. Using this extension enables a model preview (similar to the solid view) on the Ultimaker S5 touchscreen and in Cura Connect.

*Compressed Gcode
Gcode saved from Ultimaker Cura using the Ultimaker 3 profile is compressed (using gzip) to save space on printers.

*Circular prime tower
Prime towers are now circular, resulting in a less jerky print head action, a more robust structure, better layer adhesion, and better build plate adhesion compared to square prime towers, reducing the chance of prime tower failure mid-print.

*Connected infill lines
Grid and triangular infill patterns now have connected lines for a more constant flow, better model rigidity, and reduced impact on the quality of the outer wall.

*Support blocker - fieldOfView
Generate a cube mesh to prevent support material generation in specific areas of a model. Each cube can be scaled, rotated, and moved with the standard adjustment tools to fit your requirements. When the support blocker tool is selected, single click in the area you want to block support to generate a mesh. If it is positioned by accident, click it again to remove it.

*Real bridging - smartavionics
New experimental feature that detects bridges, adjusting the print speed, slow and fan speed to enhance print quality on bridging parts.

*Updated CuraEngine executable - thopiekar & Ultimaker B.V.
The CuraEngine executable contains a dedicated icon, author and license info on Windows now. The icon has been designed by Ultimaker B.V.

*Use RapidJSON and ClipperLib from system libraries
Application updated to use verified copies of libraries, reducing maintenance time keeping them up to date (the operating system is now responsible), as well as reducing the amount of code shipped (as necessary code is already on the user’s system).

*Initial layer flow
New setting in the ‘material’ category where the initial layer flow can be adjusted.

*Initial travel move retraction - smartavionics
Retraction has been added to the initial travel move, reducing the chance of prime blobs getting dragged into parts before brim/skirts are printed.

*Unnecessary retractions in spiralize - smartavionics
Removes retractions on layer change in spiralize mode, improving model quality.

*Faster travel paths - smartavionics
Until now, the path order optimizer worked on the basis that the shortest possible route could be taken from any one point to another. When combing is used, any route may longer, due to the need to route around obstacles. Now, it can use the combed distances to give more consistent results.

*New plugins - Pheneeny
Three new plugins have been added to Ultimaker Cura: Scalable extra prime, Print temperature offset, and Enclosure fan.

*Pre-heat extruders - fieldOfView
This new feature allows to preheat the extruders in the printer monitor.

*Renamed TweakAtZ to ‘ChangeAtZ’
This script has been renamed to be more consistent with other scripts.

*Import XML material profile checks
XML material profile files are now checked before import in Ultimaker Cura to avoid potential issues. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*Bug fixes
- Slice engine crash default temperature 0. Fixed an issue where the slicing engine could crash when slicing with a material at 0°C.
- Network printer reconnect. Fixed an issue where the user could not connect to the printer after losing connection.
- Pause at height ‘redo layers’ broken. Fixed an issue where setting ‘pause at height redo layers’ to 1 or more would cause failed prints.
- Reset icon fix. Fixed an issue where manually reverting a default print profile value instead of using the reset button would cause the reset icon to remain.
- Infill density for all extruders. The infill density in the recommended mode now applies to all extruders instead of extruder 1.
- Polypropylene 0.25mm print profile. Fixed the maximum number of allowed extrusions for all 0.25mm Polypropylene profile prints.
- SolidWorks plugin. Replaced comtypes module with win32com to fix issues.
- Font rendering issues. Fixed font rendering issues on Max OSX.
- Slice engine avoids broken wall segments. Fixed an issue where narrow walls created broken line segments by testing for such situations and using slightly narrow lines in those cases.

[3.2.1]
*Bug fixes
- Fixed issues where Cura crashes on startup and loading profiles
- Updated translations
- Fixed an issue where the text would not render properly

[3.2.0]
*Tree support
Experimental tree-like support structure that uses ‘branches’ to support prints. Branches ‘grow’ and multiply towards the model, with fewer contact points than alternative support methods. This results in better surface finishes for organic-shaped prints.

*Adaptive layers
Prints with a variable layer thickness which adapts to the angle of the model’s surfaces. The result is high-quality surface finishes with a marginally increased print time. This setting can be found under the experimental category.

*Faster startup
Printer definitions are now loaded when adding a printer, instead of loading all available printers on startup.

*Backface culling in layer view
Doubled frame rate by only rendering visible surfaces of the model in the layer view, instead of rendering the entire model. Good for lower spec GPUs as it is less resource-intensive.

*Multi build plate
Experimental feature that creates separate build plates with shared settings in a single session, eliminating the need to clear the build plate multiple times. Multiple build plates can be sliced and sent to a printer or printer group in Cura Connect. This feature must be enabled manually in the preferences ‘general’ tab.

*Improved mesh type selection
New button in the left toolbar to edit per model settings, giving the user more control over where to place support. Objects can be used as meshes, with a drop down list where ‘Print as support’, ‘Don't overlap support with other models’, ‘Modify settings for overlap with other models’, or ‘Modify settings for infill of other models’ can be specified. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*View optimization
Quick camera controls introduced in version 3.1 have been revised to create more accurate isometric, front, left, and right views.

*Updated sidebar to QtQuick 2.0
Application framework updated to increase speed, achieve a better width and style fit, and gives users dropdown menus that are styled to fit the enabled Ultimaker Cura theme, instead of the operating system’s theme.

*Hide sidebar
The sidebar can now be hidden/shown by selecting View > Expand/Collapse Sidebar, or with the hotkey CMD + E (Mac) or CTRL + E (PC and Linux).

*Disable ‘Send slice information’
A shortcut to disable ‘Send slice information’ has been added to the first launch to make it easier for privacy-conscious users to keep slice information private.

*Signed binaries (Windows)
For security-conscious users, the Windows installer and Windows binaries have been digitally signed to prevent “Unknown application” warnings and virus scanner false-positives.

*Start/end gcode script per extruder
Variables from both extruders in the start and end gcode snippets can now be accessed and edited, creating uniformity between profiles in different slicing environments. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*OctoPrint plugin added to plugin browser
This plugin enables printers managed with OctoPrint to print via Ultimaker Cura interface (version 3.2 or later).

*Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the mirror tool and center model options when used together would reset the model transformations
- Updated config file path to fix crashes caused by user config files that are located on remote drives
- Updated Arduino drivers to fix triggering errors during OTA updates in shared environments. This also fixes an issue when upgrading the firmware of the Ultimaker Original.
- Fixed an issue where arranging small models would fail, due to conflict with small model files combined with the “Ensure models are kept apart” option

[3.1.0]
*Profile added for 0.25 mm print core
This new print core gives extra fine line widths which gives prints extra definition and surface quality.

*Profile added for Breakaway material
New material profile for Breakaway material, a new dry post processing support material, which can be used for models with flat surface area overhangs.

*Layer view
The existing Layer View has been updated in order to see a live simulation of all the paths within a layer.

*Quick camera controls
New buttons have been added to the interface that can quickly reposition the camera view of the buildplate.

*Lock model on platform
The move tool has a new option to lock a selected model to the platform.

*Faster profile switching speed
Duplicating and removing a profile could take Ultimaker Cura quite some time, it now happens instantly.

*Faster printer selection
Removing a printer from the library is now instant. No more unresponsive screens.

*Faster processing speed
A 5 - 10 % speed increase when calculating normals, loading models, and slicing.

*Feedrate visualization
Feedrate visualization has been added to the Layer view. Using this gives the user an idea of the print speeds per model part, allowing for better control over prints.

*Jogging
It allows the printhead to be moved with on-screen controls. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*Large model loading
A new feature has been added which unloads the layer view when switching to solid mode, speeding Ultimaker Cura back up without losing your G-code/layer view information.

*Scripts folder
A scripts folder is now available in the Ultimaker Cura configuration folder. This folder can be loaded with post processing plugins scripts, which will automatically show in Ultimaker Cura. Contributed by fieldOfView.

*Optimized workflow for crash reporting
Crash reports are automatically generated and allow the user, in case of a crash, to easily send their report with a description to developers.

*Floating models enabled
In previous releases, models were dropped to the build plate when support was disabled. Models now float when the setting is enabled (even if creates an impossible-to-print situation). This can be used to stack separate models on top of each other.

*Slicing tolerance
A new setting that affects the intersect point to influence the dimensional accuracy for diagonal surfaces. The user can select the behaviour: ‘Inclusive’ makes gaps narrower, ‘Exclusive’ makes gaps wider, and ‘Middle’ is the fastest to process. This can be used to create better tolerances for printed screw holes. Contributed by BagelOrb.

*Optimized zig zag patterns
Zig zag patterns now print more consistently. Lines now have a 5 micron tolerance in which they are printed any way, resulting in longer connected lines. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Aligned z-seam inner wall moves
Inner wall travel moves are aligned with the z-seam. This reduces the number of travel moves and reduces the chance of more unwanted seams.

*Relative positioning of infill patterns
Infill patterns are now positioned relative to the center of loaded models and an offset can be applied to control the infill more precisely and adjust it to preference or strength. Contributed by smartavionics.

*Line resolution
Enables the user to specify the minimum allowed distance value between two points in G-code to create lower or higher resolution polygons.

*Custom mode changes
If profile settings have been modified in recommended mode under custom mode, a reset icon will appear to notify the user. Click the icon to show the changes that have been made, and revert back to the default profile settings.

*Bugfixes
- Fix for layer numbers being displayed incorrectly when switching between solid and layer mode
- Fix for Ultimaker Cura engine crashes on certain models
- Fix for Uninstalling previous versions of Cura on Windows platforms
- Fix for displaying visible settings
- Fix for importing legacy .ini files
- Prevent skipping user agreement dialog by pressing escape

[3.0.4]
*Bug fixes
- Fixed OpenGL issue that prevents Cura from starting.

*License agreement on the first startup has been added

[3.0.3]
*Bug fixes
- Add missing libraries for the MakePrintable plugin.

[3.0.0]
*Faster start-up
Start-up speed has been cut in half compared to the previous version.

*New color scheme
Color scheme has been updated to reflect Ultimaker Cura rebrand.

*Updated UX design
The Ultimaker Cura logo has moved from the bottom to the top of the interface. Print status icons have been updated and repositioned.

*Redesigned splash screen
A new splash screen on Ultimaker Cura startup has been added.

*Top navigation bar improvements
The width of tab functionality changes accordingly to the word space (multilingual).

*Print quality slider
A slider can now be used to control the quality profile in recommended mode.

*Infill slider
Model infill can now be changed using a slider in recommended mode.

*Changed layer view
Layer view icon, panel and slider have moved to top-right of interface.

*Rasterized build plate
The build plate now shows graduations of 10 mm and 1 mm for easy model positioning.

*Changed row of extruder buttons
Extruder tabs have become buttons and icons have been updated.

*Add an "Export to Cura" button in SOLIDWORKS
A macro can be added to your SOLIDWORKS installation that loads your model into Ultimaker Cura.

*Siemens NX macro
When a user updates models in Siemens NX and clicks the button, the updated models replace the models opened in Ultimaker Cura.

*Skin removal width
Remove thin strips of skin from a model to prevent print head zigzagging, in turn preventing vibrations.

*Skin expand distance
Cutting away skins on steep overhangs makes prints less sturdy. By expanding skins with the thickness of walls, features will be better supported. In addition, features such as towers on top of infill will be stronger.

*Extra skin wall count
Printing extra skin directly on top of infill can lead to gaps, curling and pillowing. This is reduced by printing a wall around the skin first, and also improves the printing speed.

*Minimum extrusion for skin
Will prevent filling small gaps that are probably filled already, resulting in less strings, better top details and faster prints.

*PVA retractions
PVA (switch) retraction length is increased, minimum travel distance for retraction is decreased and max count is slightly increased, this reduces stringing by a lot at the cost of slightly increased print time.

*Z seam options
Gives the user control over where to place the seam - hide it in convex corners or in easy to remove locations such as concave corners. Don’t let corner angles influence the seam position.

*Quarter cubic infill
Similar to tetrahedral (octet) infill, but half of the lines are shifted half of the period up. This pattern sacrifices some rigidity of octet infill for greater toughness.

*Cross infill
A fractal pattern infill that requires fewer retractions than other infill types. This is useful for flexible materials as it causes less material elongation. The internal structure given by this infill also assists flexible models having more resistance, while retaining ‘soft’ properties in all directions.

*Layer start negative position
Layer start X/Y values can be less than 0 when the machine centre is zero.

*PostProcessing stretch script
This new script performs "post stretch" algorithm to fix the problem of insufficient inner and outer diameters. Thanks to electrocbd for contributing.

*Ironing speed settings
Ironing speed settings have been moved to experimental category.

*Doodle3D plugin
Update Doodle3D plugin to connect with printers. Thanks to mith for contributing.

*Bug fixes
- Customized profiles are not sent when connecting to a printer
- Sync z-hop with layer changes, thanks to smartavionics for contributing
- Memory leaks on MacOS
- Printer name not loaded when project file is opened
- Doodle3D Wifi box was selected by default on non-UM3 printers

[2.7.0]
*Top surface skin
Specify print settings of the top-most layers separately in order to improve print duration and achieve higher quality top surfaces.

*Print thin walls
An experimental function that enables features to be printed up to two times smaller than the nozzle size.

*Ironing (a.k.a. Neosanding)
An experimental function that enables the heated nozzle to travel over printed top layers without extrusion to create a smooth finish. Made after an idea by Neotko.

*Gradual support infill
Supports will print faster and with less material while improving overhang quality.

*Support infill layer thickness
Users are able to configure “Support infill layer thickness” for thicker support layers.

*Relative Z seam
A function that positions the Z seam relative to the bounding box of the model, so that the seam stays at the same location no matter what the position of the object is.

*Prime tower purge
In order to prevent under extrusion when printing a prime tower, and to prevent a prime tower failing half way through a job, a feature has been added to wipe off oozed/purged material in the middle of a hollow prime tower before starting to print the next layer of it. The amount of material to purge can be specified in the “Prime Tower Purge Volume” setting.

*First layer line width
A multiplier setting for the line width of the first layer of a print. Multiplying line width gives fewer lines but with greater width, which improves build plate adhesion.

*Pause standby and resume temperature
Turn off the nozzle when printing with extended pauses to prevent burned filament and nozzle clogging. At the end of a pause, the nozzle will reach printing temperature before resuming a print.

*Extruder per feature
Assign specific print features (walls, infill, skin, etc.) to a specific nozzle. A possible application of this would be to print an outer shell of an object with a fine nozzle at a greater level of detail while using a larger second nozzle to print infill faster.

*Dark theme
A dark theme for Cura. Select this theme to reduce eyestrain when working in dark environments. Activate it by selecting “Preferences > Themes > Dark".

*Top navigation bar redesign
The top bar user interface been improved so that “Prepare” and “Print” have moved from the right side of the interface to the left side.

*New keyboard shortcuts
Models can now be manipulated on the build plate using hotkeys Q, A, Z, W, and tab keys. Q selects “move”, A selects “scale”, Z selects “rotate”, and W selects “mirror”. Use the tab key to navigate between settings.

*Plugin browser
Easily download and install plugins using an integrated plugin browser. Go to “Extensions > Plugin Browser > Browse plugins” to select it.

*Import SolidWorks files as STL
A new plugin that enables SolidWorks compatible .SLDPRT files to be imported directly into Cura, where they are automatically converted to .STL format. This plugin can be found in the plugin browser.

*Zoom towards mouse cursor position
Cura preferences now include an option to zoom towards the cursor position on screen.

*Increased scroll speed in setting lists
The scroll speed in the setting lists is now three times faster than previous versions.

*Extra tooltips
Extra tooltips have been added to clarify the machine settings.

*Polish now supported
Polish language support added. This can be selected in the preferences menu.

*Chinese now supported
Chinese language support added. This can be selected in the preferences menu.

[2.6.2]

*Bug fixes
- Fixed an issue with Cura crashing on older versions of MacOS.

[2.6.1]
*New profiles
The Polypropylene material is added and supported with the Ultimaker 3. Support for CPE+ and PC with 0.8mm nozzles is added as well.

[2.6.0]
*Cura versions
Cura 2.6 has local version folders, which means the new version won’t overwrite the existing configuration and profiles from older versions, but can create a new folder instead. You can now safely check out new beta versions and, if necessary, start up an older version without the danger of losing your profiles.

*Better support adhesion
We’ve added extra support settings to allow the creation of improved support profiles with better PVA/PLA adhesion. The Support Interface settings, such as speed and density, are now split up into Support Roof and Support Floor settings.

*Multi-extrusion support for custom FDM printers
Custom third-party printers and Ultimaker modifications now have multi-extrusion support. Thanks to Aldo Hoeben for this feature.

*Model auto-arrange
We’ve improved placing multiple models or multiplying the same ones, making it easier to arrange your build plate. If there’s not enough build plate space or the model is placed beyond the build plate, you can rectify this by selecting ‘Arrange all models’ in the context menu or by pressing Command+R (MacOS) or Ctrl+R (Windows and Linux). Cura 2.6 will then find a better solution for model positioning.

*Gradual infill
You can now find the Gradual Infill button in Recommended mode. This setting makes the infill concentrated near the top of the model – so that we can save time and material for the lower parts of the model. This functionality is especially useful when printing with flexible materials.

*Support meshes
It’s now possible to load an extra model that will be used as a support structure.

*Mold
This is a bit of an experimental improvement. Users can use it to print a mold from a 3D model, which can be cast afterwards with the material that you would like your model to have.

*Towers for tiny overhangs
We’ve added a new support option allowing users to achieve more reliable results by creating towers to support even the smallest overhangs.

*Cutting meshes
Easily transform any model into a dual-extrusion print by applying a pattern for the second extruder. All areas of the original model, which also fall inside the pattern model, will be printed by the extruder selected for the pattern.

*Extruder per model selection via the context menu or extruder buttons
You can now select the necessary extruder in the right-click menu or extruder buttons. This is a quicker and more user-friendly process. The material color for each extruder will also be represented in the extruder icons.

*Custom toggle
We have made the interface a little bit cleaner and more user-friendly for switching from Recommended to Custom mode.

*Plugin installer
It used to be fairly tricky to install new plugins. We have now added a button to select and install new plugins with ease – you will find it in Preferences.

*Project-based menu
It’s a lot simpler to save and open files, and Cura will know if it’s a project, model, or gcode.

*Theme picker
If you have a custom theme, you can now apply it more easily in the preferences screen.

*Time estimates per feature
You can hover over the print time estimate in the lower right corner to see how the printing time is divided over the printing features (walls, infill, etc.). Thanks to 14bitVoid for this feature.

*Invert the direction of camera zoom
We’ve added an option to invert mouse direction for a better user experience.

*Olsson block upgrade
Ultimaker 2 users can now specify if they have the Olsson block installed on their machine. Thanks to Aldo Hoeben for this feature.

*OctoPrint plugin
Cura 2.6 allows users to send prints to OctoPrint. Thanks to Aldo Hoeben for this feature.

*Bug fixes
- Post Processing plugin
- Font rendering
- Progress bar
- Support Bottom Distance issues

*3rd party printers
- MAKEIT
- Alya
- Peopoly Moai
- Rigid3D Zero
- 3D maker

[2.5.0]
*Improved speed
We’ve made changing printers, profiles, materials, and print cores even faster. 3MF processing is also much faster now. Opening a 3MF file now takes one tenth of the time.

*Speedup engine – Multithreading
Cura can process multiple operations at the same time during slicing. Supported by Windows and Linux operating systems only.

*Preheat the build plate (with a connected printer)
Users can now set the Ultimaker 3 to preheat the build plate, which reduces the downtime, allowing to manually speed up the printing workflow.

*Better layout for 3D layer view options
An improved layer view has been implemented for computers that support OpenGL 4.1. For OpenGL 2.0 to 4.0, we will automatically switch to the old layer view.

*Disable automatic slicing
An option to disable auto-slicing has been added for the better user experience.

*Auto-scale off by default
This change speaks for itself.

*Print cost calculation
The latest version of Cura now contains code to help users calculate the cost of their prints. To do so, users need to enter a cost per spool and an amount of materials per spool. It is also possible to set the cost per material and gain better control of the expenses. Thanks to our community member Aldo Hoeben for adding this feature.

*G-code reader
The g-code reader has been reintroduced, which means users can load g-code from file and display it in layer view. Users can also print saved g-code files with Cura, share and re-use them, as well as preview the printed object via the g-code viewer. Thanks to AlephObjects for this feature.

*Discard or Keep Changes popup
We’ve changed the popup that appears when a user changes a printing profile after setting custom printing settings. It is now more informative and helpful.

*Bug fixes
- Window overflow: On some configurations (OS and screen dependant), an overflow on the General (Preferences) panel and the credits list on the About window occurred. This is now fixed.
- “Center camera when the item is selected”: This is now set to ‘off’ by default.
- Removal of file extension: When users save a file or project (without changing the file type), no file extension is added to the name. It’s only when users change to another file type that the extension is added.
- Ultimaker 3 Extended connectivity. Selecting Ultimaker 3 Extended in Cura let you connect and print with Ultimaker 3, without any warning. This now has been fixed.
- Different Y / Z colors: Y and Z colors in the tool menu are now similar to the colors on the build plate.
- No collision areas: No collision areas used to be generated for some models when "keep models apart" was activated. This is now fixed.
- Perimeter gaps: Perimeter gaps are not filled often enough; we’ve now amended this.
- File location after restart: The old version of Cura didn’t remember the last opened file location after it’s been restarted. Now it has been fixed.
- Project name: The project name changes after the project is opened. This now has been fixed.
- Slicing when error value is given (print core 2): When a support is printed with the Extruder 2 (PVA), some support settings will trigger a slice when an error value is given. We’ve now sorted this out.
- Support Towers: Support Towers can now be disabled.
- Support bottoms: When putting one object on top of another with some space in between, and selecting support with support bottom interface, no support bottom is printed. This has now been resolved.
- Summary box size: We’ve enlarged the summary box when saving the project.
- Cubic subdivision infill: In the past, the cubic subdivision infill sometimes didn’t produce the infill (WIN) – this has now been addressed.
- Spiralize outer contour and fill small gaps: When combining Fill Gaps Between Walls with Spiralize Outer Contour, the model gets a massive infill.
- Experimental post-processing plugin: Since the TweakAtZ post-processing plugin is not officially supported, we added the  ‘Experimental’ tag.

*3rd party printers (bug fixes)
- Folgertech printer definition has been added.
- Hello BEE Prusa printer definition has been added.
- Velleman Vertex K8400 printer definitions have been added for both single-extrusion and dual-extrusion versions.
- Material profiles for Cartesio printers have been updated.

[2.4.0]
*Project saving & opening
You can now save your build plate configuration - with all your active machine’s meshes and settings. When you reopen the project file, you’ll find that the build plate configuration and all settings will be exactly as you last left them when you saved the project.

*Setting search
You can now search the custom settings directly from the side panel, which means you can easily locate the setting you need to tweak. Thanks to community member Aldo Hoeben & LulzBot for this feature.

*Editing start g-code and end g-code
Aldo Hoeben also added this feature, enabling you to alter both start and end code g-code settings for single extrusion machines.

*Multiply object function
By right-clicking on an object, you can multiply it by a variable amount, rather than duplicating multiple times. Thanks again to Aldo Hoeben for this feature.

*Ultimaker 3 single extrusion prints
Dual extrusion printers now allow for single extrusion prints in a larger printable area.

*Streaming printer monitor view
Ultimaker 3’s camera views no longer only show snapshots. They now show a live stream.

*Explain why slicing is disabled
When slicing is blocked by settings with error values, a message now appears, clearly indicating which settings need to be changed.

*Ultimaker 3 print profiles
The initial and final printing temperatures reduce the amount of oozing during PLA-PLA, PLA-PVA and Nylon-PVA prints. This means printing a prime tower is now optional (except for CPE and ABS at the moment). The new Ultimaker 3 printing profiles ensure increased reliability and shorter print time.

*Initial Layer Printing Temperature
Initial and final printing temperature settings have been tuned for higher quality results. For all materials the initial print temperature is 5 degrees above the default value.

*Printing temperature of the materials
The printing temperature of the materials in the material profiles is now the same as the printing temperature for the Fine profile.

*Improved PLA-PVA layer adhesion
The PVA jerk and acceleration have been optimized to improve the layer adhesion between PVA and PLA.

*Default build plate adhesion type for Nylon
The default build plate adhesion type for Nylon prints has been changed from raft to brim.

*Support Interface Thickness
The Support Roof Thickness is now 0.8 mm and PVA support infill has been slightly decreased to lower the printing time.

*Ultimaker 2+ PC prints
In the polycarbonate profiles, the raft settings for the 0.25 mm and 0.4 mm nozzles are tweaked for less warping.

*Hollow prime tower
Print the prime tower hollow to minimize material use while maintaining stability. Wiping the oozed material on the prime tower is now done from the inside, which means the excess material is contained within the prime tower.

*Precooling and prewarming
Printing now starts at a lower temperature, before increasing swiftly to the normal printing temperature. Cooling also starts earlier than the last extrusion (with that print core). This minimizes the material’s heat absorption, which decreases the amount of degradation of the PVA material. This reduces the risk of clogging your nozzles.

*Remove Mesh Intersection
You are now able to turn off resolving of overlapping meshes. Models can now overlap, so you can perform build plate color mixing, by placing meshes over one another and lowering their flow.

*Alternate Mesh Removal
For areas where two models overlap, let each layer of the overlapping volume alternate (depending on which object the overlapping area of that layer belongs to). This improves the bonding between dual color models and allows for more controlled build plate color mixing.

*Hollow Object
Remove the infill from a mesh and treat internal cavities as overhangs, so as to create support in the model’s interior. This experimental setting greatly reduces the amount of material needed on the inside of the print.

*Fill Gaps Between Walls
Fill up small gaps between consecutive walls, making thin pieces in your model dense, rather than hollow. This feature makes the thin pieces stronger.

*Cubic subdivision infill
This experimental new infill pattern is similar to cubic infill, but generates bigger cubes farther inside the mesh. This greatly reduces print times and material use, while maintaining structural integrity. Thanks to community members Martin Boerwinckle and Nicholas Seward for this feature.

*Concentric 3D infill
This new infill pattern is similar to concentric infill, but touches the shell every X layers, creating better support for the top layers.

* Printing Temperature Initial Layer
Nozzle temperature to be used during the first layer.

*Build Plate Temperature Initial Layer
Bed temperature to be used during the first layer.

*Initial Fan Speed
Fan speed to be used during the first layer.

*Retract at Layer Change
Retract each time the printer progresses to the next layer.

*Outer Wall Wipe Distance
Wipe the nozzle after printing the outer wall.

*Set X-Y coordinate of z-seam
Select where to place the Z seam.

*Start Layers with the Same Part
Start each layer with the part closest to a given location.

*Turn off nozzle after last use
Turn off the nozzle after its last use, while other nozzles are still in use.

[2.3.0]
*Multi Extrusion Support
Machines with multiple extruders are now supported. Ultimaker 3 printers and Ultimaker Original printers with dual extrusion upgrade kit are currently supported.

*Network Printing for Ultimaker 3
Sending a print to an Ultimaker 3 remotely via the network is now possible. Requires Wi-Fi or LAN to connect to the printer.

*Print Monitoring for Ultimaker 3
You can monitor your print on an Ultimaker 3 with a live camera feed. Requires Wi-Fi or LAN to connect to the printer.

*Material and Print Core Synchronization
Connecting to an Ultimaker 3 now gives you the option to synchronize the materials in Cura with what is loaded in the printer.

*Speed improvements
The first thing you will notice is the speed. STL loading is now 10 to 20 times faster, layer view is significantly faster and slicing speed is slightly improved.

*Improved Position Tool
Place objects precisely where you want them by manually entering the values for the position.

*Custom Machine Support
It’s now much easier to use Cura with custom machines. You can edit the machine settings when you load a new custom machine.

Disable the g-code prefix in Preferences. No more UM2_ on your printer display!

*Print Weight Estimates
Cura now estimates print weight as well as length.

*Automatic Import Configuration
Configurations from older installations of Cura 2.1 are automatically imported into the newest installation.

*Slicing features
*Infill Types
Two new infill types are now introduced: Tetrahedral and Cubic. They change along with the Z-axis for more uniform strength in all directions. There are now seven infill types to choose from.

*Gradual Infill
Gradual infill lets users adjust infill density, based on the distance from the top layers. This offers faster printing and reduced material requirements, whilst maintaining surface quality.

*Set Acceleration and Jerk by Feature
You can now set Jerk and Acceleration by feature-type (infill, walls, top/bottom, etc), for more precision.

*Outer Wall Offset
If your outer wall line width is smaller than your nozzle size, move the nozzle a bit inward when printing the outer wall, to improve surface quality.

*Enhanced Combing
The “No Skin” option allows you to comb over infill only to avoid scars on top surfaces.

*Z Hop
Can’t avoid previously printed parts by horizontal moves? The Z Hop Only Over Printed Parts gives you the ability to Z Hop to avoid collisions for better surface quality.

*Skin and Wall Overlap
The Skin Overlap setting allows you to overlap the skin lines with the walls for better adhesion.

*Adjust Initial Layer Travel Speed
Set the travel speed of the initial layer(s) to reduce risk of extruder pulling the print from the bed.

*Support Interface
It is now possible to print a support bottom as well as a support roof. Support bottoms are placed where the support rests on the model. Printing the support interface with PVA leads to improved surface quality.

*Bug fixes
Deleting grouped objects
Duplicating groups
Bridging
Drag and drop (first Windows run)
Unretraction speeds
Bottom layer in Spiralize mode
Overlap Compensation

Bed lowering speed can be adjusted for each layer

[2.1.3]

*Material Profiles
New material profiles for CPE+, PC, Nylon and TPU for the Ultimaker 2+ family.

[2.1.2]

Cura has been completely reengineered from the ground up for an even more seamless integration between hardware, software and materials. Together with its intuitive new user interface, it’s now also ready for any future developments. For the beginner Cura makes 3D printing incredibly easy, and for more advanced users, there are over 200 customizable settings.

*Select Multiple Objects
You now have the freedom to select and manipulate multiple objects at the same time.

*Grouping
You can now group objects together to make it easier to manipulate multiple objects.

*Undo/Redo
You can now undo and redo your actions, like moving an object or scaling.

*Setting Profiles
The new GUI allows custom profiles to load easily and intuitively, directly from Cura.

*3MF File Loading Support
We’re happy to report we now support loading 3MF files. This is a new file format similar to AMF, but freely available.

*Intuitive Cut-Off Object Bottom
We’ve added a feature that allows you to move objects below the build plate. You can either correct a model with a rough bottom, or print only a part of an object. Please note that the implementation differs greatly from the old one when it was just a setting.

*64-bit Windows Builds
An optimized 64-bit Windows Cura version is now available. This allows you to load larger model files.

*Automatic calculations
Cura allows you to set a number of lines/layers instead of millimeters. The engine automatically calculates the right settings.

*Per-Object Settings
Per-object settings allow you to override individual profile settings per object.

*Engine Features

*Line Width
Line width settings added per feature: Global, Walls, Top/Bottom, Infill, Skirt, Support.

*Pattern Settings
Pattern settings improved per feature: Top/Bottom, Infill, Support.

*Shell

*Alternate Skin Rotation
Helps to combat the pillowing problem on top layers.

*Alternate Extra Wall
For better infill adhesion.

*Horizontal Expansion
Allows to compensate model x,y-size to get a 1:1 result.

*Travel

*Avoid Printed Parts
When moving to the next part to print, avoid collisions between the nozzle and other parts which are already printed.

*Support

*Stair Step Height
Sets the balance between sturdy and hard to remove support. By setting steps of the stair-like bottom of the support resting on the model.

*ZigZag
A new, infill type that’s easily breakable, introduced specially for support.

*Support Roofs
A new sub-feature to reduce scars the support leaves on overhangs.

*Support Towers
Specialized support for tiny overhang areas.

*Special Modes

*Surface Mode
This mode will print the surface of the mesh instead of the enclosed volume. This used to be called ‘Only follow mesh surface’. In addition to the ‘surface mode’ and ‘normal’, a ‘both’ mode has now been added. This ensures all closed volumes are printed as normal and all loose geometry as single walls.

*Experimental Features

*Conical Support
An experimental filament, cost-reduction feature, for support.

*Draft Shield
Prints a protective wall at a set distance around the object that prevents air from hitting the print, reducing warping.

*Fuzzy Skin
Prints the outer walls with a jittering motion to give your object a diffuse finish.

*Wire Printing
The object is printed with a mid-air / net-like structure, following the mesh surface. The build plate will move up and down during diagonal segments. Though not visible in layer view, you can view the result in other software, such as Repetier Host or http://chilipeppr.com/tinyg.

New Features
------------

* Plugin based system
  The Uranium framework provides us with a plugin-based system
  that provides additional flexibility when extending Cura. Think
  of new views, tools, file formats, etc. This is probably the
  biggest new feature.
* Improved UI
  The UI has received a complete overhaul.
* Time-Quality Slider
  The 4 static quick print profiles have been replaced with
  a slider that should make it easier to find the right spot
  between print time and print quality.
* More Settings
  The Advanced mode is now configurable and can show many
  additional settings that were previously not available, while at
  the same time not overwhelming new users with too many settings.
  Custom set of visible settings can be created by the user.
* Support for high-DPI screens
  The refreshed UI has been designed with high-DPI screens in
  mind which should improve the experience of Cura on such
  devices.
* Improved language support
  (Not yet available for the Beta release.)
* Improved support structure generation
  The new version of the CuraEngine now features improved
  support generation algorithms and additional options for support
  structure generation.
* Experimental Feature: Wire Printing
  Wire Printing has been added as an experimental new feature. It
  will print objects as a structure of lines. It can be enabled by
  from Advanced Mode -> Fixes -> Wire Printing.
* Undo/Redo
  It is now possible to undo and redo most scene operations, like
  moving or rotating objects.

Features from earlier versions not (yet) in this release
--------------------------------------------------------

* The All-at-once/One-at-a-time toggle is not available.
  We are working on an improved implementation of this mechanism
  but it will not be available for this release.
* No dual extrusion features are available yet.
  We are working on a completely new workflow for this but this
  needs additional time.
* “Lay Flat” has been removed.
  The existing implementation was unfortunately not salvageable.
  We will be looking into an improved implementation for this
  feature.
* "Split Object Into Parts" has been removed.
  Due to the same reason as Lay Flat.
* Support for AMF and DAE file formats has been removed.
  Both of these will be implemented as plugins in the future.
* Support for directly loading a GCode file is not yet available.
  This will be implemented as a plugin in the future.
* Support for PNG, JPG and other image formats has been removed.
  These can be supported by a plugin with an improved UI.
* Support for loading Minecraft levels has been removed.
  This can be implemented as a plugin.
* Windows XP support has been dropped.
  Microsoft is no longer supporting xp, so they no longer back
  port certain features that we require.
* X-Ray view is missing.
  Will be implemented as a (you might have guessed it) plugin.
* Fixes: Follow Mesh Surface
  Has been removed from the engine, the same result can be
  achieved using no infill or top/bottom layers.

Known Issues
------------
* Some OBJ files are rendered as black objects due to missing
  normals.
* Disabling plugins does not work correctly yet.
* Unicorn occasionally still requires feeding. Do not feed it
  after midnight.
