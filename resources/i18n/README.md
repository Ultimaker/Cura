When we're in the release-window (so that's when we have the beta out for the next Cura, but not the final release yet), we're also in the process of updating translations.
_**If you make a PR with updated or fixed translations within this timespan, it's likely that your additions/changes will be ignored in favour of the 'official' ones, due to how our process is set up.**_
