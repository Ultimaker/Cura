Release process for Cura
------------------------

It is highly recommended to use git-buildpackage (gbp) to prepare updated
packages. This tool will automatically verify the Debian tree against
the upstream sources and generate separate source and debian tarballs.

Packaging instructions (1 and 2 only need to be done once):

1.  Obtain the sources:

  $ gbp clone ssh://git.debian.org/git/3dprinter/packages/cura.git
  $ cd cura

2.  Add the upstream repository and fetch the tree:

  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura.git
  $ git fetch --all

3.  Import the latest upstream release:

  $ git fetch --all
  $ gbp import-orig --uscan

  This will fetch the latest upstream release into the upstream branch
  and create and commit a pristine-tar from it.

4.  Update the changelog:

  $ dch -a -v <UPSTREAM_VERSION>-<DEBIAN_VERSION>

  Replace UPSTREAM_VERSION with the version fetched in step 3 and
  DEBIAN_VERSION with 1. If you are creating a new Debian release
  from a previous package version, increment DEBIAN_VERSION by 1 each time.
  This will open a text editor where you can edit the changelog entry.
  Include a "Closes #..." entry if this release fixes a Debian bug.

5.  Refresh and verify the patches:

  $ quilt push -a

  This applies all patches. If you encounter any errors, fix them.
  Make sure to refresh all patches that have changed and remove those that
  aren't needed any more.
  Commit the updated patches using git, then unapply them:

  $ quilt pop -a; rm -rf .pc

6.  Build against the upstream tree:

  $ gbp buildpackage -us -uc

7.  Verify that you don't have any lintian warnings:

  $ linitian -I

8.  Merge your changes back into the debian tree, tag and push everything:

  $ gbp buildpackage --git-tag --git-sign-tags
  $ git push --tags origin master upstream pristine-tar

9.  Sign your package and release using dput or whichever method you prefer:

  $ debsign
  $ dput <RELEASE_REPOSITORY> ../libarcus_<VERSION>.changes
