[2.5.0]
*Improved speed
We’ve made changing printers, profiles, materials, and print cores even faster. 3MF processing is also much faster now. Opening a 3MF file now takes one tenth of the time.

*Speedup engine – Multithreading
Cura can process multiple operations at the same time during slicing. Supported by Windows and Linux operating systems only.

*Preheat the build plate (with a connected printer)
Users can now set the Ultimaker 3 to preheat the build plate, which reduces the downtime, allowing to manually speed up the printing workflow.

*Better layout for 3D layer view options
An improved layer view has been implemented for computers that support OpenGL 4.1. For OpenGL 2.0 to 4.0, we will automatically switch to the old layer view.

*Disable automatic slicing
An option to disable auto-slicing has been added for the better user experience.

*Auto-scale off by default
This change speaks for itself.

*Print cost calculation
The latest version of Cura now contains code to help users calculate the cost of their prints. To do so, users need to enter a cost per spool and an amount of materials per spool. It is also possible to set the cost per material and gain better control of the expenses. Thanks to our community member Aldo Hoeben for adding this feature.

*G-code reader
The g-code reader has been reintroduced, which means users can load g-code from file and display it in layer view. Users can also print saved g-code files with Cura, share and re-use them, as well as preview the printed object via the g-code viewer. Thanks to AlephObjects for this feature.

*Discard or Keep Changes popup
We’ve changed the popup that appears when a user changes a printing profile after setting custom printing settings. It is now more informative and helpful.

*Bug fixes
- Window overflow: On some configurations (OS and screen dependant), an overflow on the General (Preferences) panel and the credits list on the About window occurred. This is now fixed.
- “Center camera when the item is selected”: This is now set to ‘off’ by default.
- Removal of file extension: When users save a file or project (without changing the file type), no file extension is added to the name. It’s only when users change to another file type that the extension is added.
- Ultimaker 3 Extended connectivity. Selecting Ultimaker 3 Extended in Cura let you connect and print with Ultimaker 3, without any warning. This now has been fixed.
- Different Y / Z colors: Y and Z colors in the tool menu are now similar to the colors on the build plate.
- No collision areas: No collision areas used to be generated for some models when "keep models apart" was activated. This is now fixed.
- Perimeter gaps: Perimeter gaps are not filled often enough; we’ve now amended this.
- File location after restart: The old version of Cura didn’t remember the last opened file location after it’s been restarted. Now it has been fixed.
- Project name: The project name changes after the project is opened. This now has been fixed.
- Slicing when error value is given (print core 2): When a support is printed with the Extruder 2 (PVA), some support settings will trigger a slice when an error value is given. We’ve now sorted this out.
- Support Towers: Support Towers can now be disabled.
- Support bottoms: When putting one object on top of another with some space in between, and selecting support with support bottom interface, no support bottom is printed. This has now been resolved.
- Summary box size: We’ve enlarged the summary box when saving the project.
- Cubic subdivision infill: In the past, the cubic subdivision infill sometimes didn’t produce the infill (WIN) – this has now been addressed.
- Spiralize outer contour and fill small gaps: When combining Fill Gaps Between Walls with Spiralize Outer Contour, the model gets a massive infill.
- Experimental post-processing plugin: Since the TweakAtZ post-processing plugin is not officially supported, we added the  ‘Experimental’ tag.

*3rd party printers (bug fixes)
- Folgertech printer definition has been added.
- Hello BEE Prusa printer definition has been added.
- Velleman Vertex K8400 printer definitions have been added for both single-extrusion and dual-extrusion versions.
- Material profiles for Cartesio printers have been updated.

[2.4.0]
*Project saving & opening
You can now save your build plate configuration - with all your active machine’s meshes and settings. When you reopen the project file, you’ll find that the build plate configuration and all settings will be exactly as you last left them when you saved the project.

*Setting search
You can now search the custom settings directly from the side panel, which means you can easily locate the setting you need to tweak. Thanks to community member Aldo Hoeben & LulzBot for this feature.

*Editing start g-code and end g-code
Aldo Hoeben also added this feature, enabling you to alter both start and end code g-code settings for single extrusion machines.

*Multiply object function
By right-clicking on an object, you can multiply it by a variable amount, rather than duplicating multiple times. Thanks again to Aldo Hoeben for this feature.

*Ultimaker 3 single extrusion prints
Dual extrusion printers now allow for single extrusion prints in a larger printable area.

*Streaming printer monitor view
Ultimaker 3’s camera views no longer only show snapshots. They now show a live stream.

*Explain why slicing is disabled
When slicing is blocked by settings with error values, a message now appears, clearly indicating which settings need to be changed.

*Ultimaker 3 print profiles
The initial and final printing temperatures reduce the amount of oozing during PLA-PLA, PLA-PVA and Nylon-PVA prints. This means printing a prime tower is now optional (except for CPE and ABS at the moment). The new Ultimaker 3 printing profiles ensure increased reliability and shorter print time.

*Initial Layer Printing Temperature
Initial and final printing temperature settings have been tuned for higher quality results. For all materials the initial print temperature is 5 degrees above the default value.

*Printing temperature of the materials
The printing temperature of the materials in the material profiles is now the same as the printing temperature for the Fine profile.

*Improved PLA-PVA layer adhesion
The PVA jerk and acceleration have been optimized to improve the layer adhesion between PVA and PLA.

*Default build plate adhesion type for Nylon
The default build plate adhesion type for Nylon prints has been changed from raft to brim.

*Support Interface Thickness
The Support Roof Thickness is now 0.8 mm and PVA support infill has been slightly decreased to lower the printing time.

*Ultimaker 2+ PC prints
In the polycarbonate profiles, the raft settings for the 0.25 mm and 0.4 mm nozzles are tweaked for less warping.

*Hollow prime tower
Print the prime tower hollow to minimize material use while maintaining stability. Wiping the oozed material on the prime tower is now done from the inside, which means the excess material is contained within the prime tower.

*Precooling and prewarming
Printing now starts at a lower temperature, before increasing swiftly to the normal printing temperature. Cooling also starts earlier than the last extrusion (with that print core). This minimizes the material’s heat absorption, which decreases the amount of degradation of the PVA material. This reduces the risk of clogging your nozzles.

*Remove Mesh Intersection
You are now able to turn off resolving of overlapping meshes. Models can now overlap, so you can perform build plate color mixing, by placing meshes over one another and lowering their flow.

*Alternate Mesh Removal
For areas where two models overlap, let each layer of the overlapping volume alternate (depending on which object the overlapping area of that layer belongs to). This improves the bonding between dual color models and allows for more controlled build plate color mixing.

*Hollow Object
Remove the infill from a mesh and treat internal cavities as overhangs, so as to create support in the model’s interior. This experimental setting greatly reduces the amount of material needed on the inside of the print.

*Fill Gaps Between Walls
Fill up small gaps between consecutive walls, making thin pieces in your model dense, rather than hollow. This feature makes the thin pieces stronger.

*Cubic subdivision infill
This experimental new infill pattern is similar to cubic infill, but generates bigger cubes farther inside the mesh. This greatly reduces print times and material use, while maintaining structural integrity. Thanks to community members Martin Boerwinckle and Nicholas Seward for this feature.

*Concentric 3D infill
This new infill pattern is similar to concentric infill, but touches the shell every X layers, creating better support for the top layers.

* Printing Temperature Initial Layer
Nozzle temperature to be used during the first layer.

*Build Plate Temperature Initial Layer
Bed temperature to be used during the first layer.

*Initial Fan Speed
Fan speed to be used during the first layer.

*Retract at Layer Change
Retract each time the printer progresses to the next layer.

*Outer Wall Wipe Distance
Wipe the nozzle after printing the outer wall.

*Set X-Y coordinate of z-seam
Select where to place the Z seam.

*Start Layers with the Same Part
Start each layer with the part closest to a given location.

*Turn off nozzle after last use
Turn off the nozzle after its last use, while other nozzles are still in use.

*Option for no build plate adhesion
Select not to print any build plate adhesion helper parts.

*Anti-overhang and support meshes
Use a mesh to specify a volume within which to classify nothing as overhang for support or specify a volume within which to print support.

*Delta printer support
This release adds support for printers with elliptic buildplates. This feature has not been extensively tested so please let us know if it works or get involved in improving it.

*AppImage for Linux
The Linux distribution is now in AppImage format, which makes Cura easier to install.

*Print Weight Estimates
Cura now estimates print weight as well as length.

*Automatic Import Configuration
Configurations from older installations of Cura 2.1 are automatically imported into the newest installation.

*Slicing features
*Infill Types
Two new infill types are now introduced: Tetrahedral and Cubic. They change along with the Z-axis for more uniform strength in all directions. There are now seven infill types to choose from.

*Gradual Infill
Gradual infill lets users adjust infill density, based on the distance from the top layers. This offers faster printing and reduced material requirements, whilst maintaining surface quality.

*Set Acceleration and Jerk by Feature
You can now set Jerk and Acceleration by feature-type (infill, walls, top/bottom, etc), for more precision.

*Outer Wall Offset
If your outer wall line width is smaller than your nozzle size, move the nozzle a bit inward when printing the outer wall, to improve surface quality.

*Enhanced Combing
The “No Skin” option allows you to comb over infill only to avoid scars on top surfaces.

*Z Hop
Can’t avoid previously printed parts by horizontal moves? The Z Hop Only Over Printed Parts gives you the ability to Z Hop to avoid collisions for better surface quality.

*Skin and Wall Overlap
The Skin Overlap setting allows you to overlap the skin lines with the walls for better adhesion.

*Adjust Initial Layer Travel Speed
Set the travel speed of the initial layer(s) to reduce risk of extruder pulling the print from the bed.

*Support Interface
It is now possible to print a support bottom as well as a support roof. Support bottoms are placed where the support rests on the model. Printing the support interface with PVA leads to improved surface quality.

*Bug fixes

[2.1.3]

*Material Profiles
New material profiles for CPE+, PC, Nylon and TPU for the Ultimaker 2+ family.

[2.1.2]

Cura has been completely reengineered from the ground up for an even more seamless integration between hardware, software and materials. Together with its intuitive new user interface, it’s now also ready for any future developments. For the beginner Cura makes 3D printing incredibly easy, and for more advanced users, there are over 200 customizable settings.

*Select Multiple Objects
You now have the freedom to select and manipulate multiple objects at the same time.

*Grouping
You can now group objects together to make it easier to manipulate multiple objects.

*Undo/Redo
You can now undo and redo your actions, like moving an object or scaling.

*Setting Profiles
The new GUI allows custom profiles to load easily and intuitively, directly from Cura.

*3MF File Loading Support
We’re happy to report we now support loading 3MF files. This is a new file format similar to AMF, but freely available.

*Intuitive Cut-Off Object Bottom 
We’ve added a feature that allows you to move objects below the build plate. You can either correct a model with a rough bottom, or print only a part of an object. Please note that the implementation differs greatly from the old one when it was just a setting.

*64-bit Windows Builds 
An optimized 64-bit Windows Cura version is now available. This allows you to load larger model files.

*Automatic calculations
Cura allows you to set a number of lines/layers instead of millimeters. The engine automatically calculates the right settings.

*Per-Object Settings
Per-object settings allow you to override individual profile settings per object.

*Engine Features

*Line Width
Line width settings added per feature: Global, Walls, Top/Bottom, Infill, Skirt, Support.

*Pattern Settings
Pattern settings improved per feature: Top/Bottom, Infill, Support.

*Shell

*Alternate Skin Rotation
Helps to combat the pillowing problem on top layers.

*Alternate Extra Wall
For better infill adhesion.

*Horizontal Expansion
Allows to compensate model x,y-size to get a 1:1 result.

*Travel

*Avoid Printed Parts
When moving to the next part to print, avoid collisions between the nozzle and other parts which are already printed.

*Support

*Stair Step Height
Sets the balance between sturdy and hard to remove support. By setting steps of the stair-like bottom of the support resting on the model.

*ZigZag
A new, infill type that’s easily breakable, introduced specially for support.

*Support Roofs
A new sub-feature to reduce scars the support leaves on overhangs.

*Support Towers
Specialized support for tiny overhang areas.

*Special Modes

*Surface Mode
This mode will print the surface of the mesh instead of the enclosed volume. This used to be called ‘Only follow mesh surface’. In addition to the ‘surface mode’ and ‘normal’, a ‘both’ mode has now been added. This ensures all closed volumes are printed as normal and all loose geometry as single walls.

*Experimental Features

*Conical Support
An experimental filament, cost-reduction feature, for support.

*Draft Shield
Prints a protective wall at a set distance around the object that prevents air from hitting the print, reducing warping.

*Fuzzy Skin
Prints the outer walls with a jittering motion to give your object a diffuse finish.

*Wire Printing
The object is printed with a mid-air / net-like structure, following the mesh surface. The build plate will move up and down during diagonal segments. Though not visible in layer view, you can view the result in other software, such as Repetier Host or http://chilipeppr.com/tinyg.
