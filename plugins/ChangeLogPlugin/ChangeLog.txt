[2.3.0]

*Speed improvements
The first thing you will notice is the speed. STL loading is now 10 to 20 times faster, layer time is significantly faster and slicing speed is slightly improved.

*Multi Extrusion Support
Machines with multiple extruders are now supported. If you’ve got the Ultimaker Original with the dual extrusion upgrade kit, we’ve got you covered.

*Custom Machine Support
The new custom machine plug-in allows you to change machine settings with ease. That means it’s now much easier to use Cura with custom machines.

*Improved Position Tool
Place objects precisely where you want them by manually entering the values for the position.

*Improved Grouping
It's now possible to transform objects that are already grouped.
Select an individual item in a group or merged object and edit as usual. Just Ctrl + Click and edit away.

*Enhanced Profile Management
Profile management is improved. You can now easily see and track changes made to your profiles.

*Improved Setting Visibility
Make multiple settings visible at once. The Visibility Overview setting indicates why a setting is not shown in the sidebar even if it is selected.

*Improved time estimation
Time estimations are more accurate. Based on our test time estimations should be within 5% accuracy.

*Optional G-code Machine Prefix
Disable the g-code prefix in Preferences. No more UM2_ on your printer display!

*Print Weight Estimates
Cura now estimates print weight as well as length.

*Automatic Import Configuration
Configurations from older installations of Cura 2.1 are automatically imported into the newest installation.

*Slicing features
*Infill Improvements
We've introduced two new infill types: Tetrahedral and Cubic. They change along with the Z-axis for more uniform strength in all directions. Also, now you can change the density of the infill based on the distance from the top layers. You print get faster, use less material, and maintain the same object strength.

*Set Acceleration and Jerk by Feature
You can now set Jerk and Acceleration by feature, (infill, walls, top/bottom, etc) for more precision.

*Outer Wall Offset
Apply an offset to where the outer wall is printed for better surface quality when the outer wall line width is smaller than the nozzle size.

*Enhanced Combing
The “No Skin” option allows you to comb over infill only to avoid scars on top surfaces.

*Z Hop
Can’t avoid previously printed parts by horizontal moves? The Z Hop Only Over Printed Parts gives you the ability to Z Hop to avoid collisions for better surface quality.

*Skin and Wall Overlap
The Skin Overlap setting allows you to overlap the skin lines with the walls for better adhesion.

*Control Initial Layer Travel Speed
Set the travel speed of the initial layer(s) to reduce risk of extruder pulling the print from the bed.

*Support Bottoms
This new feature duplicates the Support Roofs feature in the places where the support rests on the model.

*Auto Temperature
Automatically change the temperature of a layer based on the average flow of material in the layer.

*Bug fixes & minor changes
Deleting grouped objects works as intended again.
Duplicating groups works as intended again.
Bridging works as intended again.
Rafts are no longer printed outside of build area.
Messages are now displayed 30 seconds instead of 10, making it less likely that certain messages are missed.
Drag and drop on the first run on windows works again.
You are now notified if you try to save to a locked SD card.
Combing is applied in more cases and results in better paths.
Infill thickness now supports Grid infill also for even multiples of the layer height.
Unretraction speeds are correct again.
Spiralize mode doesn’t spiralize the bottom layer any more.
Spiralize now spiralizes each part in a layer.
Support is no longer removed by unprintable thin parts of the model.
Support is now generated on each layer it’s supposed to.
Support doesn't go outside overhang areas any more.
Line distance is now the actual line distance.
Enabling raft doesn’t influence at which height the model is sliced any more.
Brim is now always printed just once.
Overlap Compensation works as intended again.
A raft now produces a reasonable amount of retractions.
No more string plume on top of one-at-a-time printed objects.
Engine log can be viewed even when slicing is finished.
Support roofs now only occur just below overhang.
Brim is now also generated under the support.
Compensate overlapping wall parts now also works for inner walls.
Bed Level and Checkup procedures for UMO+ can now be done without re-adding machine.
Undo and Redo now work correctly with multiple operations.
The last used folder is now remembered (instead of defaulting to home folder)
You can now adjust the speed at which the bed is lowered each layer.
Support roofs now only generate directly below the mesh.
Settings shared between skirt and brim now also activate when brim is selected.
Made it possible to add multiple Per Model Settings at once.

[2.1.3]

*Material Profiles
New material profiles for CPE+, PC, Nylon and TPU for the Ultimaker 2+ family.

[2.1.2]

Cura has been completely reengineered from the ground up for an even more seamless integration between hardware, software and materials. Together with its intuitive new user interface, it’s now also ready for any future developments. For the beginner Cura makes 3D printing incredibly easy, and for more advanced users, there are over 200 customizable settings.

*Select Multiple Objects
You now have the freedom to select and manipulate multiple objects at the same time.

*Grouping
You can now group objects together to make it easier to manipulate multiple objects.

*Undo/Redo
You can now undo and redo your actions, like moving an object or scaling.

*Setting Profiles
The new GUI allows custom profiles to load easily and intuitively, directly from Cura.

*3MF File Loading Support
We’re happy to report we now support loading 3MF files. This is a new file format similar to AMF, but freely available.

*Intuitive Cut-Off Object Bottom 
We’ve added a feature that allows you to move objects below the build plate. You can either correct a model with a rough bottom, or print only a part of an object. Please note that the implementation differs greatly from the old one when it was just a setting.

*64-bit Windows Builds 
An optimized 64-bit Windows Cura version is now available. This allows you to load larger model files.

*Automatic calculations
Cura allows you to set a number of lines/layers instead of millimeters. The engine automatically calculates the right settings.

*Per-Object Settings
Per-object settings allow you to override individual profile settings per object.

*Engine Features

*Line Width
Line width settings added per feature: Global, Walls, Top/Bottom, Infill, Skirt, Support.

*Pattern Settings
Pattern settings improved per feature: Top/Bottom, Infill, Support.

*Shell

*Alternate Skin Rotation
Helps to combat the pillowing problem on top layers.

*Alternate Extra Wall
For better infill adhesion.

*Horizontal Expansion
Allows to compensate model x,y-size to get a 1:1 result.

*Travel

*Avoid Printed Parts
When moving to the next part to print, avoid collisions between the nozzle and other parts which are already printed.

*Support

*Stair Step Height
Sets the balance between sturdy and hard to remove support. By setting steps of the stair-like bottom of the support resting on the model.

*ZigZag
A new, infill type that’s easily breakable, introduced specially for support.

*Support Roofs
A new sub-feature to reduce scars the support leaves on overhangs.

*Support Towers
Specialized support for tiny overhang areas.

*Special Modes

*Surface Mode
This mode will print the surface of the mesh instead of the enclosed volume. This used to be called ‘Only follow mesh surface’. In addition to the ‘surface mode’ and ‘normal’, a ‘both’ mode has now been added. This ensures all closed volumes are printed as normal and all loose geometry as single walls.

*Experimental Features

*Conical Support
An experimental filament, cost-reduction feature, for support.

*Draft Shield
Prints a protective wall at a set distance around the object that prevents air from hitting the print, reducing warping.

*Fuzzy Skin
Prints the outer walls with a jittering motion to give your object a diffuse finish.

*Wire Printing
The object is printed with a mid-air / net-like structure, following the mesh surface. The build plate will move up and down during diagonal segments. Though not visible in layer view, you can view the result in other software, such as Repetier Host or http://chilipeppr.com/tinyg.
