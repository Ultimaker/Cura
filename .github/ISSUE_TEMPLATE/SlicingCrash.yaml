       ### 💥 Slicing Crash Analysis Tool 💥
       We are taking steps to analyze an increase in reported crashes more systematically. We'll need some help with that. 😇
       Before filling out the report below, we want you to try a special Cura 5.7 Alpha.
       This version of Cura has an updated slicing engine that will automatically send a report to the Cura Team for analysis. 
       #### [You can find the downloads here](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/discussions/18080) #### 
       If you still encounter a crash you are still welcome to report the issue so we can use your model as a test case, you can find instructions on how to do that below.      
       
       ### Project File
       **⚠️ Before you continue, we need your project file to troubleshoot a slicing crash.**
       It contains the printer and settings we need for troubleshooting.

       To save a project file go to File -> Save project. 
       Please make sure to .zip your project file. 
       For big files, you may need to use [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) or similar file-sharing sites.
       
       🤔 Before you share, please think to yourself. Is this a model that can be shared?
           Unfortunately we cannot help if this file is missing. 
           Do you have the project file? Than let's continue ⬇️
