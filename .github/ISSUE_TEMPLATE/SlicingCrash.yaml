       ### ‚ú®Try our improved Cura 5.7‚ú®
       Before filling out the report below, we want you to try the latest Cura 5.7. 
       This version of Cura has become significantly more reliable and has an updated slicing engine that will automatically send a report to the Cura Team for analysis. 
       #### [You can find the downloads here](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/releases/latest) #### 
       If you still encounter a crash you are still welcome to report the issue so we can use your model as a test case, you can find instructions on how to do that below.      
       
       ### Project File
       **‚ö†Ô∏è Before you continue, we need your project file to troubleshoot a slicing crash.**
       It contains the printer and settings we need for troubleshooting.

       To save a project file go to File -> Save project. 
       Please make sure to .zip your project file. 
       For big files, you may need to use [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) or similar file-sharing sites.
       
       ü§î Before you share, please think to yourself. Is this a model that can be shared?
           Unfortunately we cannot help if this file is missing. 
           Do you have the project file? Than let's continue ‚¨áÔ∏è
