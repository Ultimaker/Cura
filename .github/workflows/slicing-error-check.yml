            This issue is related to a slicing error, but it seems a project file (`.zip`) is missing.
            Please attach a `.zip` file containing your project (including models and profiles) so we can reproduce the issue.
            This will help us investigate and resolve the problem more effectively.
            Have Cura open with your project that fails to slice, go to `Help` > `Export Package For Technical Support`, and save the package.
            Then create a .zip file with the package, attach the `.zip` file to this issue.
            If you have already attached a `.zip` file, please ensure it is correctly linked in the issue body.
