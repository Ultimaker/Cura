Processing an issue will go much faster when this is filled out, and issues which do not use this template WILL BE REMOVED and no fix will be considered!

Before filing, PLEASE check if the issue already exists (either open or closed) by using the search bar on the issues page. If it does, comment there. Even if it's closed, we can reopen it based on your comment.

Also, please note the application version in the title of the issue. For example: "[3.2.1] Cannot connect to 3rd-party printer". Please do NOT write things like "Request:" or "[BUG]" in the title; this is what labels are for.

Thank you for using Cura!
